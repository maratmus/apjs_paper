  abstract      = {Context. The advent of deep multiwavelength extragalactic surveys has led to the necessity for advanced and fast methods for photometric analysis. In fact, codes which allow analyses of the same regions of the sky observed at different wavelengths and resolutions are becoming essential to thoroughly exploit current and future data. In this context, a key issue is the confusion (i.e. blending) of sources in low-resolution images. <BR /> Aims: We present t-phot, a publicly available software package developed within the astrodeep project. t-phot is aimed at extracting accurate photometry from low-resolution images, where the blending of sources can be a serious problem for the accurate and unbiased measurement of fluxes and colours. <BR /> Methods: t-phot can be considered as the next generation to tfit, providing significant improvements over and above it and other similar codes (e.g. convphot). t-phot gathers data from a high-resolution image of a region of the sky, and uses this information (source positions and morphologies) to obtain priors for the photometric analysis of the lower resolution image of the same field. t-phot can handle different types of datasets as input priors, namely i) a list of objects that will be used to obtain cutouts from the real high-resolution image; ii) a set of analytical models (as .fits stamps); iii) a list of unresolved, point-like sources, useful for example for far-infrared (FIR) wavelength domains. <BR /> Results: By means of simulations and analysis of real datasets, we show that t-phot yields accurate estimations of fluxes within the intrinsic uncertainties of the method, when systematic errors are taken into account (which can be done thanks to a flagging code given in the output). t-phot is many times faster than similar codes like tfit and convphot (up to hundreds, depending on the problem and the method adopted), whilst at the same time being more robust and more versatile. This makes it an excellent choice for the analysis of large datasets. When used with the same parameter sets as for tfit it yields almost identical results (although in a much shorter time); in addition we show how the use of different settings and methods significantly enhances the performance. <BR /> Conclusions: t-phot proves to be a state-of-the-art tool for multiwavelength optical to far-infrared image photometry. Given its versatility and robustness, t-phot can be considered the preferred choice for combined photometric analysis of current and forthcoming extragalactic imaging surveys.  t-phot is publicly available for downloading from <A href=``http://www.astrodeep.eu/t-phot/''>http://www.astrodeep.eu/t-phot/</A>},

  abstract = {The Flexible Image Transport System (FITS) has been used by astronomers for over 30 years as a data interchange and archiving format; FITS files are now handled by a wide range of astronomical software packages. Since the FITS format definition document (the {\ldquo}standard{\rdquo}) was last printed in this journal in 2001, several new features have been developed and standardized, notably support for 64-bit integers in images and tables, variable-length arrays in tables, and new world coordinate system conventions which provide a mapping from an element in a data array to a physical coordinate on the sky or within a spectrum. The FITS Working Group of the International Astronomical Union has therefore produced this new version 3.0 of the FITS standard, which is provided here in its entirety. In addition to describing the new features in FITS, numerous editorial changes were made to the previous version to clarify and reorganize many of the sections. Also included are some appendices which are not formally part of the standard. The FITS standard is likely to undergo further evolution, in which case the latest version may be found on the FITS Support Office Web site at $\lt$ext-link ext-link-type=``uri'' xlink:href=``http://fits.gsfc.nasa.gov/''$\gt$http://fits.gsfc.nasa.gov/$\lt$/ext-link$\gt$, which also provides many links to FITS-related resources.},

The technique, which derives from Bayes' theorem on conditional probabili- ties, conserves the constraints on frequency distributions (i.e., normalization and non-negativeness) and, at each iteration, increases the likelihood of the observed sample. The behavior of the technique is explored by applying it to roblems whose solutions are known in the limit of infinite sample size, and excellent results are obtained after a few iterations. The astronomical use of the technique is illustrated by applying it to the problem of rectifying distributions of v sin i for aspect effect; calculations are also reported illustrating the technique's possible use for correcting radio-astronomical observations for beam-smoothing. Application to the problem of obtaining unbiased, smoothed histograms is also suggested.},

  abstract      = {The Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) satellite observed the full sky in four mid-infrared bands in the 2.8-28 {$\mu$}m range. The primary mission was completed in 2010. The WISE team has done a superb job of producing a series of high-quality, well-documented, complete data releases in a timely manner. However, the ``Atlas Image'' coadds that are part of the recent AllWISE and previous data releases were intentionally blurred. Convolving the images by the point-spread function while coadding results in ``matched-filtered'' images that are close to optimal for detecting isolated point sources. But these matched-filtered images are sub-optimal or inappropriate for other purposes. For example, we are photometering the WISE images at the locations of sources detected in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey through forward modeling, and this blurring decreases the available signal-to-noise by effectively broadening the point-spread function. This paper presents a new set of coadds of the WISE images that have not been blurred. These images retain the intrinsic resolution of the data and are appropriate for photometry preserving the available signal-to-noise. Users should be cautioned, however, that the W3- and W4-band coadds contain artifacts around large, bright structures (large galaxies, dusty nebulae, etc.); eliminating these artifacts is the subject of ongoing work. These new coadds, and the code used to produce them, are publicly available at <A href=``http://unwise.me''>http://unwise.me</A>.},

Stripe 82 covers an area of \~{}300 deg$^{2}$ on the celestial equator, and has been repeatedly scanned 70-90 times in the ugriz bands by the SDSS imaging survey. By making use of all available data in the SDSS archive, our co-added images are optimized for depth. Input single-epoch frames were properly processed and weighted based on seeing, sky transparency, and background noise before co-addition. The resultant products are co-added science images and their associated weight images that record relative weights at individual pixels. The depths of the co-adds, measured as the 5{$\sigma$} detection limits of the aperture (3.''2 diameter) magnitudes for point sources, are roughly 23.9, 25.1, 24.6, 24.1, and 22.8 AB magnitudes in the five bands, respectively. They are 1.9-2.2 mag deeper than the best SDSS single-epoch data. The co-added images have good image quality, with an average point-spread function FWHM of \~{}1'' in the r, i, and z bands. We also release object catalogs that were made with SExtractor. These co-added products have many potential uses for studies of galaxies, quasars, and Galactic structure. We further present and release near-IR J-band images that cover \~{}90 deg$^{2}$ of Stripe 82. These images were obtained using the NEWFIRM camera on the NOAO 4 m Mayall telescope, and have a depth of about 20.0-20.5 Vega magnitudes (also 5{$\sigma$} detection limits for point sources).},

  abstract      = {Fitting the spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of galaxies is an almost universally used technique that has matured significantly in the last decade. Model predictions and fitting procedures have improved significantly over this time, attempting to keep up with the vastly increased volume and quality of available data. We review here the field of SED fitting, describing the modelling of ultraviolet to infrared galaxy SEDs, the creation of multiwavelength data sets, and the methods used to fit model SEDs to observed galaxy data sets. We touch upon the achievements and challenges in the major ingredients of SED fitting, with a special emphasis on describing the interplay between the quality of the available data, the quality of the available models, and the best fitting technique to use in order to obtain a realistic measurement as well as realistic uncertainties. We conclude that SED fitting can be used effectively to derive a range of physical properties of galaxies, such as redshift, stellar masses, star formation rates, dust masses, and metallicities, with care taken not to over-interpret the available data. Yet there still exist many issues such as estimating the age of the oldest stars in a galaxy, finer details of dust properties and dust-star geometry, and the influences of poorly understood, luminous stellar types and phases. The challenge for the coming years will be to improve both the models and the observational data sets to resolve these uncertainties. The present review will be made available on an interactive, moderated web page (http://sedfitting.org), where the community can access and change the text. The intention is to expand the text and keep it up to date over the coming years.},

  abstract      = {We present post-cryogenic Spitzer imaging at 3.6 and 4.5 {$\mu$}m with the Infrared Array Camera (IRAC) of the Spitzer/HETDEX Exploratory Large-Area (SHELA) survey. SHELA covers {\ap}24 deg$^{2}$ of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey {\ldquo}Stripe 82{\rdquo} region, and falls within the footprints of the Hobby-Eberly Telescope Dark Energy Experiment (HETDEX) and the Dark Energy Survey. The HETDEX blind R {\tilde} 800 spectroscopy will produce {\tilde}200,000 redshifts from the Ly{$\alpha$} emission for galaxies in the range 1.9 $\lt$ z $\lt$ 3.5, and an additional {\tilde}200,000 redshifts from the [O II] emission for galaxies at z $\lt$ 0.5. When combined with deep ugriz images from the Dark Energy Camera, K-band images from NEWFIRM, and other ancillary data, the IRAC photometry from Spitzer will enable a broad range of scientific studies of the relationship between structure formation, galaxy stellar mass, halo mass, the presence of active galactic nuclei, and environment over a co-moving volume of {\tilde}0.5 Gpc$^{3}$ at 1.9 $\lt$ z $\lt$ 3.5. Here, we discuss the properties of the SHELA IRAC data set, including the data acquisition, reduction, validation, and source catalogs. Our tests show that the images and catalogs are 80\% (50\%) complete to limiting magnitudes of 22.0 (22.6) AB mag in the detection image, which is constructed from the weighted sum of the IRAC 3.6 and 4.5 {$\mu$}m images. The catalogs reach limiting sensitivities of 1.1 {$\mu$}Jy at both 3.6 and 4.5 {$\mu$}m (1{$\sigma$}, for R = 2{\Prime} circular apertures). As a demonstration of the science, we present IRAC number counts, examples of highly temporally variable sources, and galaxy surface density profiles of rich galaxy clusters. In the spirit of the Spitzer Exploratory programs, we provide all of the images and catalogs as part of the publication.},

  abstract      = {The Stripe 82 Massive Galaxy Catalog (s82-mgc) is the largest-volume stellar mass-limited sample of galaxies beyond z {\ap} 0.1 constructed to date. Spanning 139.4 deg$^{2}$, the s82-mgc includes a mass-limited sample of 41,770 galaxies with $\{$log$\}$$\{$M$\}$$_{*}$/$\{$M$\}$$_{⊙ }${\gsim} 11.2 to z {\ap} 0.7, sampling a volume of 0.3 Gpc$^{3}$, roughly equivalent to the volume of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey-I/II (SDSS-I/II) z $\lt$ 0.15 main sample. The catalog is built on three pillars of survey data: the SDSS Stripe 82 Coadd photometry which reaches r-band magnitudes of {\tilde}23.5 AB, Y JHK photometry at depths of 20th magnitude (AB) from the UK Infrared Deep Sky Survey Large Area Survey, and over 70,000 spectroscopic galaxy redshifts from the SDSS-I/II and the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey. We describe the catalog construction and verification, the production of 9-band matched aperture photometry, tests of existing and newly estimated photometric redshifts required to supplement spectroscopic redshifts for 55\% of the $\{$log$\}$$\{$M$\}$$_{*}$/$\{$M$\}$$_{⊙ }${\gsim} 11.2 sample, and geometric masking. We provide near-IR based stellar mass estimates and compare these to previous estimates. All catalog products are made publicly available. The s82-mgc not only addresses previous statistical limitations in high-mass galaxy evolution studies, but also begins tackling inherent data challenges in the coming era of wide-field imaging surveys.},

  abstract      = {We present the SWIRE Photometric Redshift Catalogue 1025119 redshifts of unprecedented reliability and of accuracy comparable with or better than previous work. Our methodology is based on fixed galaxy and quasi-stellar object templates applied to data at 0.36-4.5 {$\mu$}m, and on a set of four infrared emission templates fitted to infrared excess data at 3.6-170 {$\mu$}m. The galaxy templates are initially empirical, but are given greater physical validity by fitting star formation histories to them, which also allows us to estimate stellar masses. The code involves two passes through the data, to try to optimize recognition of active galactic nucleus (AGN) dust tori. A few carefully justified priors are used and are the key to supression of outliers. Extinction, A$_{V}$, is allowed as a free parameter. The full reduced {$\chi$}$^{2}$$_{ν}$ (z) distribution is given for each source, so the full error distribution can be used, and aliases investigated.  We use a set of 5982 spectroscopic redshifts, taken from the literature and from our own spectroscopic surveys, to analyse the performance of our method as a function of the number of photometric bands used in the solution and the reduced {$\chi$}$^{2}$$_{ν}$. For seven photometric bands (5 optical + 3.6, 4.5 {$\mu$}m), the rms value of (z$_{phot}$ - z$_{spec}$)/(1 + z$_{spec}$) is 3.5 per cent, and the percentage of catastrophic outliers [defined as $\gt$15 per cent error in (1 + z)], is \~{}1 per cent. These rms values are comparable with the best achieved in other studies, and the outlier fraction is significantly better. The inclusion of the 3.6- and 4.5-{$\mu$}m IRAC bands is crucial in supression of outliers.  We discuss the redshift distributions at 3.6 and 24 {$\mu$}m. In individual fields, structure in the redshift distribution corresponds to clusters which can be seen in the spectroscopic redshift distribution, so the photometric redshifts are a powerful tool for large-scale structure studies. 10 per cent of sources in the SWIRE photometric redshift catalogue have z $\gt$ 2, and 4 per cent have z $\gt$ 3, so this catalogue is a huge resource for high-redshift galaxies.  A key parameter for understanding the evolutionary status of infrared galaxies is L$_{ir}$/L$_{opt}$. For cirrus galaxies this is a measure of the mean extinction in the interstellar medium of the galaxy. There is a population of ultraluminous galaxies with cool dust and we have shown SEDs for some of the reliable examples. For starbursts, we estimate the specific star formation rate, {\phis}$_{*}$/M$_{*}$. Although the very highest values of this ratio tend to be associated with Arp220 starbursts, by no means all ultraluminous galaxies are. We discuss an interesting population of galaxies with elliptical-like spectral energy distributions in the optical and luminous starbursts in the infrared.  For dust tori around type 1 AGN, L$_{tor}$/L$_{opt}$ is a measure of the torus covering factor and we deduce a mean covering factor of 40 per cent.  Our infrared templates also allow us to estimate dust masses for all galaxies with an infrared excess.},

  abstract      = {Photometric surveys produce large-area maps of the galaxy distribution, but with less accurate redshift information than is obtained from spectroscopic methods. Modern photometric redshift (photo-z) algorithms use galaxy magnitudes, or colours, that are obtained through multiband imaging to produce a probability density function (PDF) for each galaxy in the map. We used simulated data to study the effect of using different photo-z estimators to assign galaxies to redshift bins in order to compare their effects on angular clustering and galaxy bias measurements. We found that if we use the entire PDF, rather than a single-point (mean or mode) estimate, the deviations are less biased, especially when using narrow redshift bins. When the redshift bin widths are {$\Delta$}z = 0.1, the use of the entire PDF reduces the typical measurement bias from 5 per cent, when using single point estimates, to 3 per cent.},

  abstract      = {We describe a new program for determining photometric redshifts, dubbed EAZY. The program is optimized for cases where spectroscopic redshifts are not available, or are only available for a biased subset of the galaxies. The code combines features from various existing codes: it can fit linear combinations of templates, it includes optional flux- and redshift-based priors, and its user interface is modeled on the popular HYPERZ code. A novel feature is that the default template set, as well as the default functional forms of the priors, are not based on (usually highly biased) spectroscopic samples, but on semianalytical models. Furthermore, template mismatch is addressed by a novel rest-frame template error function. This function gives different wavelength regions different weights, and ensures that the formal redshift uncertainties are realistic. We introduce a redshift quality parameter, Q$_{z}$, which provides a robust estimate of the reliability of the photometric redshift estimate. Despite the fact that EAZY is not ``trained'' on spectroscopic samples, the code (with default parameters) performs very well on existing public data sets. For K-selected samples in CDF-South and other deep fields, we find a 1 {$\sigma$} scatter in {$\Delta$} z/(1 + z) of 0.034, and we provide updated photometric redshift catalogs for the FIRES, MUSYC, and FIREWORKS surveys.},

Direct evidence on the value of n is found in the relative distribution, perpendicular to the galactic plane, of gas and young objects. For various values of n, computations were made of the initial luminosity function, the rate of star formation, the exchange of gas between stars and interstellar medium, the number of white dwarfs and their luminosity function, and the abundance of helium. It is concluded, from a comparison of the results with observational data, that n is around 2. The present rate of star formation, then, is five times slower than the average rate. The interstellar gas, of which the surface density on the galactic plane was taken to be 11 per square parsec, loses 1.4 O/pc2 per 10 years by the formation of stars but gains about one-third of this by ejection of gas from evolving stars. The present helium abundance of the interstellar gas may be explained if a star has burned, on the average, 53 per cent of its original hydrogen into helium at the time that ejection takes place. The ejected material was assumed to have a composition equal to the average composition of the star. The effect of star formation on the gas density in the galactic system and other galaxies is briefly discussed.},

The disk-averaged SFRs and gas densities for the combined sample are well represented by a Schmidt law with index N = 1.4 +/- 0.15. The Schmidt law provides a surprisingly tight parametrization of the global star formation law, extending over several orders of magnitude in SFR and gas density. An alternative formulation of the star formation law, in which the SFR is presumed to scale with the ratio of the gas density to the average orbital timescale, also fits the data very well. Both descriptions provide potentially useful ``recipes'' for modeling the SFR in numerical simulations of galaxy formation and evolution.},

Star color-color, number counts, and PSF size versus modeled size plots show that the modeling of the PSF is good enough for precision five-band photometry. Structure in the PSF model versus magnitude plot indicates minor PSF modeling errors, leading to misclassification of stars as galaxies, as verified using VVDS spectroscopy.

The Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) is mapping the whole sky following its launch on 2009 December 14. WISE began surveying the sky on 2010 January 14 and completed its first full coverage of the sky on July 17. The survey will continue to cover the sky a second time until the cryogen is exhausted (anticipated in 2010 November). WISE is achieving 5{$\sigma$} point source sensitivities better than 0.08, 0.11, 1, and 6 mJy in unconfused regions on the ecliptic in bands centered at wavelengths of 3.4, 4.6, 12, and 22 {$\mu$}m. Sensitivity improves toward the ecliptic poles due to denser coverage and lower zodiacal background. The angular resolution is 6farcs1, 6farcs4, 6farcs5, and 12farcs0 at 3.4, 4.6, 12, and 22 {$\mu$}m, and the astrometric precision for high signal-to-noise sources is better than 0farcs15.},

During the ten month lifetime of the cryogen, the instrument achieved a nominal sensitivity on the sky of 10$^{-9}$ W/m$^{2}$/sr at most wavelengths, or approximately 1\% of the natural background at wavelengths where the sky is very luminous. The short wavelength bands from 1 - 5 micrometers continue to operate after exhaustion of the cryogen, although at reduced sensitivity.

Little is known about the properties of these objects on account of their optical faintness (R \~{}$\gt$ 24). Here we report deep infrared imaging and spectroscopy of one of the extremely red objects (EROs) discovered by Hu {\amp} Ridgway in the field of the z = 3.79 quasar PC 1643+4631A. The infrared images were obtained in 0.5`` seeing and show that the object (denoted HR 10) is not a dynamically relaxed elliptical galaxy dominated by an old stellar population as was previously suspected, but instead has an asymmetric morphology suggestive of either a disk or an interacting system. The infrared spectrum of HR 10 shows a single, possibly broad emission feature at 1.60 microns, which we identify as H{$\alpha$} + [N II] at z = 1.44. The luminosity and width of this emission line indicates either intense star formation (\~{}20 h\^{}-2\^{} M\_sun\_ yr\^{}-1\^{}) or the presence of an active nucleus. Based on the rest frame UV-optical spectral energy distribution, the luminosity of HR 10 is estimated to be 3-8 L\^{}*\^{}. The colors of HR 10 are unusually red for a galaxy (at z = 1.44 the age of HR 10 is at most 2-8 Gyr depending on cosmology) and indicate that HR 10 is dusty. HR 10 is detected weakly at radio wavelengths; this is consistent with either the starburst or active galactic nucleus hypothesis. If HR 10 is a typical representative of its class, EROs are numerous and represent a significant component of the luminous objects in the universe at z \~{} 1.5.},

  abstract = {We have obtained spectroscopic redshifts for 24 sources from a sample of bright, K-selected extremely red objects (EROs) using the Keck I Telescope. These EROs have high-resolution morphologies from the Hubble Space Telescope and were selected with a median K$_{s}$ magnitude of 18.7 and F814W-K$_{s}$$\gt$4 mag (Yan {\amp} Thompson 2003). Among the 24 redshifts, the majority (92\%) are at 0.9$\lt$z$\lt$1.5. We derived the rest-frame J-band luminosity function at z$_{median}$=1.14. Our result suggests that the luminosity evolution between bright EROs at z\~{}1 and the present-day greater than L* massive galaxies is at most about 0.7 mag. Combining the morphologies and deep spectroscopy revealed that the 24 EROs have the following properties: (1) Eighty-six percent of the spectra have absorption features from old stars, suggesting that the dominant stellar populations seen in the rest-frame UV are old stars. Fifty percent of the sources have pure absorption lines, while the remaining 50\% have emission lines, indicating recent star formation. We conclude that the color criterion for EROs is very effective in selecting old stellar populations at z\~{}1, and a large fraction of these systems with prominent old stellar populations also have recent star formation. (2) The 12 emission-line systems have the same number of disk and bulge galaxies as in the remaining 12 pure absorption-line systems. We conclude that spectral classes do not have a simple, direct correspondence with morphological types. (3) Three EROs could be isolated, pure passively evolving early-type galaxies at z\~{}1. This implies that only a small fraction (10\%-15\%) of early-type galaxies are formed in a rapid burst of star formation at high redshifts and evolved passively since then. (4) Three EROs have very red continua and pure emission-line spectra. Their redshifts and star formation rates are similar to that of HR 10. These three sources are potential candidates for dusty starbursts. (5) We identified three active galactic nuclei (13\%), which is consistent with what has been found by deep Chandra observations.},

  abstract = {The WIYN High Resolution Infrared Camera (WHIRC) is a high-resolution near-infrared imager (0.8-2.5 {$\mu$}m) designed to produce superb images over a moderate (3.3$^{‧}$ {\times} 3.4$^{‧}$) field of view on the WIYN 3.5 m telescope at Kitt Peak National Observatory. It takes scientific advantage of the excellent image quality produced by the telescope and its image stabilization subsystem, the WIYN Tip-Tilt Module (WTTM), which is located on one of two Nasmyth ports. WHIRC mounts to WTTM and reimages the WTTM focal plane to a plate scale of 0.1{\Prime} pixel$^{-1}$ at the WHIRC detector. Its straight-through optical path makes for a compact, very low mass, instrument{\mdash}a necessity, given the stringent moment-loading requirement at the WTTM interface. The WHIRC optical path consists of a vacuum window, a five-element collimator, a dual filter wheel, a five-element achromatic camera, and a 2k$^{2}$ Raytheon VIRGO mercury cadmium telluride (HgCdTe) detector. A novel all-aluminum lens cell design is used to achieve 13 {$\mu$}m lens centering tolerances between ambient and the 77 K operating temperature. A suite of 13 filters facilitates broadband (J, H, and K$_{s}$) imaging, as well as narrowband imaging tailored to a variety of astronomical investigations. The imaging performance of WHIRC is excellent. Irrespective of seeing, the telescope, and WTTM, WHIRC delivers 0.13{\Prime}, 0.11{\Prime}, and 0.08{\Prime} FWHM images in J, H, and K$_{s}$, respectively. On sky, the imaging is equally impressive yielding images as good as {\tilde}0.25 FWHM in K$_{s}$. In this article we describe the WHIRC design in detail and present the predicted and measured instrument performance.},

  abstract      = {Over the past two decades, an avalanche of new data from multiwavelength imaging and spectroscopic surveys has revolutionized our view of galaxy formation and evolution. Here we review the range of complementary techniques and theoretical tools that allow astronomers to map the cosmic history of star formation, heavy element production, and reionization of the Universe from the cosmic {\ldquo}dark ages{\rdquo} to the present epoch. A consistent picture is emerging, whereby the star-formation rate density peaked approximately 3.5 Gyr after the Big Bang, at z{\ap}1.9, and declined exponentially at later times, with an e-folding timescale of 3.9 Gyr. Half of the stellar mass observed today was formed before a redshift z = 1.3. About 25\% formed before the peak of the cosmic star-formation rate density, and another 25\% formed after z = 0.7. Less than {\tilde}1\% of today's stars formed during the epoch of reionization. Under the assumption of a universal initial mass function, the global stellar mass density inferred at any epoch matches reasonably well the time integral of all the preceding star-formation activity. The comoving rates of star formation and central black hole accretion follow a similar rise and fall, offering evidence for coevolution of black holes and their host galaxies. The rise of the mean metallicity of the Universe to about 0.001 solar by z = 6, one Gyr after the Big Bang, appears to have been accompanied by the production of fewer than ten hydrogen Lyman-continuum photons per baryon, a rather tight budget for cosmological reionization.},

  abstract      = {Weak lensing by large-scale structure is an invaluable cosmological tool given that most of the energy density of the concordance cosmology is invisible. Several large ground-based imaging surveys will attempt to measure this effect over the coming decade, but reliable control of the spurious lensing signal introduced by atmospheric turbulence and telescope optics remains a challenging problem. We address this challenge with a demonstration that point spread function (PSF) effects on measured galaxy shapes in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) can be corrected with existing analysis techniques. In this work, we co-add existing SDSS imaging on the equatorial stripe in order to build a data set with the statistical power to measure cosmic shear, while using a rounding kernel method to null out the effects of the anisotropic PSF. We build a galaxy catalogue from the combined imaging, characterize its photometric properties and show that the spurious shear remaining in this catalogue after the PSF correction is negligible compared to the expected cosmic shear signal. We identify a new source of systematic error in the shear-shear autocorrelations arising from selection biases related to masking. Finally, we discuss the circumstances in which this method is expected to be useful for upcoming ground-based surveys that have lensing as one of the science goals, and identify the systematic errors that can reduce its efficacy.},

(2) It can handle complex masks with varying depth. (3) It produces cluster-appropriate random points to enable large-scale structure studies. (4) All clusters are assigned a full redshift probability distribution P(z). (5) Similarly, clusters can have multiple candidate central galaxies, each with corresponding centering probabilities.

(7) The algorithm exhibits excellent photometric redshift performance, the richness estimates are tightly correlated with external mass proxies, and the completeness and purity of the corresponding catalogs are superb. We apply the redMaPPer algorithm to \~{}10, 000 deg$^{2}$ of SDSS DR8 data and present the resulting catalog of \~{}25,000 clusters over the redshift range z in [0.08, 0.55].

The median value for |{$\Delta$}z|/(1 + z) for the full sample is 0.006. The incidence of projection effects is low ($\lt$=5\%). Detailed performance comparisons of the redMaPPer DR8 cluster catalog to X-ray and Sunyaev-Zel'dovich catalogs are presented in a companion paper.},

The redMaPPer cluster finding algorithm treats this problem probabilistically, focusing exclusively on the red galaxy population. Here, we utilize Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) and Galaxy And Mass Assembly spectroscopic membership rates to validate the redMaPPer membership probability estimates for clusters with z {\isin} [0.1, 0.3]. We find small - but correctable - biases, sourced by three different systematics. The first two were expected a priori, namely blue cluster galaxies and correlated structure along the line of sight. The third systematic is new: the redMaPPer template fitting exhibits a non-trivial dependence on photometric noise, which biases the original redMaPPer probabilities when utilizing noisy data. After correcting for these effects, we find exquisite agreement ({\ap}1 per cent) between the photometric probability estimates and the spectroscopic membership rates, demonstrating that we can robustly recover cluster membership estimates from photometric data alone. As a byproduct of our analysis we find that on average unavoidable projection effects from correlated structure contribute {\ap}6 per cent of the richness of a redMaPPer galaxy cluster.

The ANNz package is demonstrated on the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 1, and for this particular data set the rms redshift error in the range 0$\lt$\~{}z$\lt$\~{}0.7 is {$\sigma$}$_{rms}$=0.023. Nonideal conditions (spectroscopic sets that are small or brighter than the photometric set for which redshifts are required) are simulated, and the impact on the photometric redshift accuracy is assessed.2},

  abstract      = {Photometric redshift estimation is becoming an increasingly important technique, although the currently existing methods present several shortcomings which hinder their application.  Most of those drawbacks are efficiently eliminated when Bayesian probability is consistently applied to this problem. The use of prior probabilities and Bayesian marginalization allows the inclusion of valuable information, e.g. the redshift distributions or the galaxy type mix, which is often ignored by other methods. In those cases when the a priori information is insufficient, it is shown how to `calibrate' the prior distributions, using even the data under consideration. There is an excellent agreement between the 108 HDF spectroscopic redshifts and the predictions of the method, with a rms error Delta z/(1+z\_spec) = 0.08 up to z$\lt$6 and no systematic biases nor outliers. The results obtained are more reliable than those of standard techniques even when the latter include near-IR colors. The Bayesian formalism developed here can be generalized to deal with a wide range of problems which make use of photometric redshifts, e.g. the estimation of individual galaxy characteristics as the metallicity, dust content, etc., or the study of galaxy evolution and the cosmological parameters from large multicolor surveys. Finally, using Bayesian probability it is possible to develop an integrated statistical method for cluster mass reconstruction which simultaneously considers the information provided by gravitational lensing and photometric redshifts.},

  abstract = {The conventional method of measuring red- shifts of remote galaxies by photographing their spectra has yielded firm results out to 60,000 km/sec, or 0.2 C. This corresponds, for the brighter members of a typical cluster of galaxies, to about 17th or i8th photovisual magnitude. Beyond this, spectrographic observations become difficult. The limit of the method is set not so much by the length of exposure required as by the presence of the spectrum of the night sky against which the superimposed spectrum of a faint galaxy must be observed. Near the limit it is not always easy to recognize features in the spectrum of a galaxy nor to distinguish them with certainty from accidental groupings of photographic grains. This situation has led us to consider alternative methods by which redshifts beyond the present spectrographic range can be adequately estimated. There are, in fact, at least four magnitudes of unexplored territory between the spectrographic limit and the faintest galaxies detectable by direct photography, and it is now clear that observations within that territory will be vital to any definitive cosmological result. In addition, the high precision of spectrographic red- shifts is not needed; we can well afford to trade a factor 10 in precision for the opportunity of reaching galaxies at larger distances. The problem is now being explored with a photoelectric technique which has already yielded some significant results for galaxies with large redshifts. By means of the photon counter at Palomar, multicolor observations have been obtained for ten galaxies in five clusters, two of which have redshifts considerably greater than 0.2 C. These data are reduced to spectral-energy distribution curves E (X). The amounts by which these E (X) curves are shifted as a whole toward the red provide a measure of the redshifts, while the areas under them provide a measure of bolometric magnitudes without the need for K corrections. The curves also provide K corrections by which conventional two-color observations of additional galaxies can be reduced to the same bolometric system. The redshift procedure rests on two conditions: (i) these E (X) curves should be on a true scale of energy per unit wave length; (2) galaxies being compared must be intrinsically similar, that is, the differences between them must be due largely to their redshifts and not to a Stebbins-Whitford effect. Since Whitford now finds that there is no pronounced peculiarity out to Z = 0.2, and since evolutionary changes would tend to appear gradually rather than suddenly, we are probably quite safe until extremely large redshifts are reached. While redshift-magnitude considerations are based on mean E (X) curves for several galaxies in each cluster, the data for individual galaxies show that ellipticals are not all exactly alike and that those of low luminosity tend to have broader and flatter maxima than those of high luminosity. An unexpected result of this work is the high infrared point at I micron, suggesting that the E (N) curves may actually have a second hump out in the infrared. The bolometric magnitudes must all be adjusted for absorption as a function of galactic latitude, for absolute magnitude as determined by rank, and for the degree to which the outskirts of each galaxy were included in the diaphragm of the photometer. This last effect, which has tended in the past to introduce systematic errors with distance, was handled here by observing individual galaxies through a sequence of concentric diaphragms to obtain intensity profiles. The final result is a plot of the logarithms of the redshifts against corrected bolometric magnitudes, each cluster being represented by a single point. The present data extend all the way from the nearby Virgo cluster to Cluster 1448 whose redshift was found to be 120,000 km/sec (or z = 0.4), and the points all fall remarkably close to a straight line of slope 5. There is no clear indication that the points favor a bend in either direction. In a sense, the apparent linearity of this relation may be rather a coincidence, because it corresponds to a cosmological model which is only an intermediate case in a continuum of possible cases. While a small departure from linearity one way or the other cannot be excluded, the amount of curvature recently estimated by Humason, Mayall, and Sandage would definitely be at variance with the present results. In this connection, the following points should be mentioned: In the first place, the present photometric data are all photoelectric, whereas the critical parts of the earlier work were photographic. In the second place, the present material extends to roughly twice as large a redshift. In the third place, all of the earlier material can be recalibrated by means of the photoelectric data and added to the diagram; when this is done, the picture is not significantly altered. Robertson's formula for the redshift-magnitude relation has the form: ntboi = 5 log cz + 1.086 (I - q - 2\~{}Z + constant, where q is a parameter identifying the cosmological model and where \~{} is an omni-purpose term to accommodate evolutionary changes in the absolute magnitudes, evolutionary changes in the K correction (that is, a Stebbins-Whitford effect), and intergalactic obscuration. The values of these factors comprising M are presently not well known, but the available evidence suggests that \~{} is likely to be considerably less than unity. If \~{}\~{}o, the observed redshift-magnitude relation yields q\~{}+I. Values from, say, +0.524]to +1.5 fall within the presently acceptable range. These results indicate that the universe either is Euclidean or is mildly curved inward, that is, closed and finite. The Euclidean case q = +0.5 is represented by the Einstein-de Sitter model in which the expansion continues indefinitely. The closed models, q $\gt$ +0.5, represent the oscillating solution in which the expansion eventually halts at a finite radius and the universe then starts contracting. Strongly curved models, either inward or outward, would not be compatible with the present results, nor would the steady-state model of Hoyle, Bondi, and Gold. From the value of q and the associated value of k, we can compute the radius of the universe, the age of the universe, and the mean density of matter in it, on the assumption that the cosmological constant is zero. The formulae for these quantities are reviewed in a paper by Hoyle and Sandage in the August issue of Pub. A. S. P. If we adopt as expansion constant 150 km/sec per megaparsec, the Euclidean case yields the age 4.3 billion years and mean density 4.2 X 10-29 g/cm3, while the closed models yield smaller ages and larger densities. Although the present material would not be incompatible with a closed model as young as 2.6 billion years (radius = 1400 mpc, density = 12.7 X 10-29 g/cm3), other evidence tends to favor something closer to the Euclidean case.

  abstract      = {We present a new near-infrared imaging survey in the four CFHTLS deep fields: the WIRCam Deep Survey or ``WIRDS''. WIRDS comprises extremely deep, high quality (FWHM \~{} 0.6{\Prime}) J, H, and K$_{s}$ imaging covering a total effective area of 2.1 deg$^{2}$ and reaching AB 50\% completeness limits of {\ap} 24.5. We combine our images with the CFHTLS to create a unique eight-band ugrizJHK$_{S}$ photometric catalogues in the four CFHTLS deep fields; these four separate fields allow us to make a robust estimate of the effect of cosmic variance for all our measurements. We use these catalogues in combination with {\ap} 9800 spectroscopic redshifts to estimate precise photometric redshifts ({$\sigma$}$_{Δz/(1 + z)}$ {\lsim} 0.03 at i $\lt$ 25), galaxy types, star-formation rates and stellar masses for a unique sample of {\ap} 1.8 million galaxies. Our JHK$_{s}$ number counts are consistent with previous studies. We apply the ``BzK'' selection to our gzK filter set and find that the star forming BzK selection successfully selects 76\% of star-forming galaxies in the redshift range 1.4 $\lt$ z $\lt$ 2.5 in our photometric catalogue, based on our photometric redshift measurement. Similarly the passive BzK selection returns 52\% of the passive 1.4 $\lt$ z $\lt$ 2.5 population identified in the photometric catalogue. We present the mass functions of the total galaxy population as a function of redshift up to z = 2 and present fits using double Schechter functions. A mass-dependent evolution of the mass function is seen with the numbers of galaxies with masses of M {\lsim} 10$^{10.75}$ still evolving at z {\lsim} 1, but galaxies of higher mass reaching their present day numbers by z \~{} 0.8-1. This is consistent with the present picture of downsizing in galaxy evolution. We compare our results with the predictions of the GALFORM semi-analytical galaxy formation model and find that the simulations provide a relatively successful fit to the observed mass functions at intermediate masses (i.e. 10 {\lsim} log (M/M$_{⊙}$) {\lsim} 11). However, as is common with semi-analytical predictions of the mass function, the GALFORM results under-predict the mass function at low masses (i.e. log (M/M$_{⊙}$) {\lsim} 10), whilst the fit as a whole degrades beyondredshifts of z \~{} 1.2. All photometric catalogues and images are made publicly available from TERAPIX and CADC.

  abstract = {We review recent determinations of the present-day mass function (PDMF) and initial mass function (IMF) in various components of the Galaxy-disk, spheroid, young, and globular clusters-and in conditions characteristic of early star formation. As a general feature, the IMF is found to depend weakly on the environment and to be well described by a power-law form for m$\gt$\~{}1 M$_{solar}$ and a lognormal form below, except possibly for early star formation conditions. The disk IMF for single objects has a characteristic mass around m$_{c}$\~{}0.08 M$_{solar}$ and a variance in logarithmic mass {$\sigma$}\~{}0.7, whereas the IMF for multiple systems has m$_{c}$\~{}0.2 M$_{solar}$ and {$\sigma$}\~{}0.6. The extension of the single MF into the brown dwarf regime is in good agreement with present estimates of L- and T-dwarf densities and yields a disk brown dwarf number density comparable to the stellar one, n$_{BD}$\~{}n$_{*}$\~{}0.1 pc$^{-3}$. The IMF of young clusters is found to be consistent with the disk field IMF, providing the same correction for unresolved binaries, confirming the fact that young star clusters and disk field stars represent the same stellar population. Dynamical effects, yielding depletion of the lowest mass objects, are found to become consequential for ages $\gt$\~{}130 Myr. The spheroid IMF relies on much less robust grounds. The large metallicity spread in the local subdwarf photometric sample, in particular, remains puzzling. Recent observations suggest that there is a continuous kinematic shear between the thick-disk population, present in local samples, and the genuine spheroid one. This enables us to derive only an upper limit for the spheroid mass density and IMF. Within all the uncertainties, the latter is found to be similar to the one derived for globular clusters and is well represented also by a lognormal form with a characteristic mass slightly larger than for the disk, m$_{c}$\~{}0.2-0.3 M$_{solar}$, excluding a significant population of brown dwarfs in globular clusters and in the spheroid. The IMF characteristic of early star formation at large redshift remains undetermined, but different observational constraints suggest that it does not extend below \~{}1 M$_{solar}$. These results suggest a characteristic mass for star formation that decreases with time, from conditions prevailing at large redshift to conditions characteristic of the spheroid (or thick disk) to present-day conditions. These conclusions, however, remain speculative, given the large uncertainties in the spheroid and early star IMF determinations.  These IMFs allow a reasonably robust determination of the Galactic present-day and initial stellar and brown dwarf contents. They also have important galactic implications beyond the Milky Way in yielding more accurate mass-to-light ratio determinations. The mass-to-light ratios obtained with the disk and the spheroid IMF yield values 1.8-1.4 times smaller than for a Salpeter IMF, respectively, in agreement with various recent dynamical determinations. This general IMF determination is examined in the context of star formation theory. None of the theories based on a Jeans-type mechanism, where fragmentation is due only to gravity, can fulfill all the observational constraints on star formation and predict a large number of substellar objects. On the other hand, recent numerical simulations of compressible turbulence, in particular in super-Alfv{\'e}nic conditions, seem to reproduce both qualitatively and quantitatively the stellar and substellar IMF and thus provide an appealing theoretical foundation. In this picture, star formation is induced by the dissipation of large-scale turbulence to smaller scales through radiative MHD shocks, producing filamentary structures. These shocks produce local nonequilibrium structures with large density contrasts, which collapse eventually in gravitationally bound objects under the combined influence of turbulence and gravity. The concept of a single Jeans mass is replaced by a distribution of local Jeans masses, representative of the lognormal probability density function of the turbulent gas. Objects below the mean thermal Jeans mass still have a possibility to collapse, although with a decreasing probability.  The page charges for this Review were partially covered by a generous gift from a PASP supporter.},

  abstract = {A universal initial mass function (IMF) is not intuitive, but so far no convincing evidence for a variable IMF exists. The detection of systematic variations of the IMF with star-forming conditions would be the Rosetta Stone for star formation. In this contribution an average or Galactic-field IMF is defined, stressing that there is evidence for a change in the power-law index at only two masses: near 0.5M$_{solar}$ and near 0.08M$_{solar}$. Using this supposed universal IMF, the uncertainty inherent in any observational estimate of the IMF is investigated by studying the scatter introduced by Poisson noise and the dynamical evolution of star clusters. It is found that this apparent scatter reproduces quite well the observed scatter in power-law index determinations, thus defining the fundamental limit within which any true variation becomes undetectable. The absence of evidence for a variable IMF means that any true variation of the IMF in well-studied populations must be smaller than this scatter. Determinations of the power-law indices {$\alpha$} are subject to systematic errors arising mostly from unresolved binaries. The systematic bias is quantified here, with the result that the single-star IMFs for young star clusters are systematically steeper by {$\Delta$}{$\alpha$}\~{}0.5 between 0.1 and 1M$_{solar}$ than the Galactic-field IMF, which is populated by, on average, about 5-Gyr-old stars. The MFs in globular clusters appear to be, on average, systematically flatter than the Galactic-field IMF (Piotto {\amp} Zoccali; Paresce {\amp} De Marchi), and the recent detection of ancient white-dwarf candidates in the Galactic halo and the absence of associated low-mass stars (Ibata et al.; M{\'e}ndez {\amp} Minniti) suggest a radically different IMF for this ancient population. Star formation in higher metallicity environments thus appears to produce relatively more low-mass stars. While still tentative, this is an interesting trend, being consistent with a systematic variation of the IMF as expected from theoretical arguments.},

Using this hypothesis and the observed luminosity function, the rate of star creation as a function of stellar mass is calculated.

  abstract = {We present a new model for computing the spectral evolution of stellar populations at ages between 1 {\times} 10$^{5}$ and 2 {\times} 10$^{10}$ yr at a resolution of 3 {\AA} across the whole wavelength range from 3200 to 9500 {\AA} for a wide range of metallicities. These predictions are based on a newly available library of observed stellar spectra. We also compute the spectral evolution across a larger wavelength range, from 91 {\AA} to 160 {$\mu$}m, at lower resolution. The model incorporates recent progress in stellar evolution theory and an observationally motivated prescription for thermally pulsing stars on the asymptotic giant branch. The latter is supported by observations of surface brightness fluctuations in nearby stellar populations. We show that this model reproduces well the observed optical and near-infrared colour-magnitude diagrams of Galactic star clusters of various ages and metallicities. Stochastic fluctuations in the numbers of stars in different evolutionary phases can account for the full range of observed integrated colours of star clusters in the Magellanic Clouds. The model reproduces in detail typical galaxy spectra from the Early Data Release (EDR) of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). We exemplify how this type of spectral fit can constrain physical parameters such as the star formation history, metallicity and dust content of galaxies. Our model is the first to enable accurate studies of absorption-line strengths in galaxies containing stars over the full range of ages. Using the highest-quality spectra of the SDSS EDR, we show that this model can reproduce simultaneously the observed strengths of those Lick indices that do not depend strongly on element abundance ratios.

  abstract = {The comoving luminosity density of the universe, L ( lambda ), is estimated from the Canada-France Redshift Survey (CFRS) faint galaxy sample in three wave bands (2800 A, 4400 A, and 1 mu m) over the redshift range 0 $\lt$ z $\lt$ 1. In all three wave bands, L increases markedly with redshift. For a (q0 = 0.5, Omega = 1.0) cosmological model, the comoving luminosity density increases as (1 + z)2.1 +/- 0.5 at 1 mu m, as (1 + z)2.7 +/- 0.5 at 4400 A, and as (1 + z)3.9 +/- 0.75 at 2800 A, these exponents being reduced by 0.43 and 1.12 for (0.05, 0.1) and (-0.85, 0.1) cosmological models, respectively. The L ( lambda )- tau relation can be reasonably well modeled by an actively evolving stellar population with a Salpeter initial mass function (IMF) extending to 125 M{\sun}, and a star formation rate declining as tau -2.5 with a turn-on of star formation at early epochs. A Scalo IMF extending to the same mass limit produces too many long-lived low-mass stars. This rapid evolution of the star formation rate and comoving luminosity density of the universe is in good agreement with the conclusions of Pei {\amp} Fall from their analysis of the evolving metallicity of the universe. One consequence of this evolution is that the physical luminosity density at short wavelengths has probably declined by 2 orders of magnitude since z \~{} 1.},

  abstract = {The Lyman decrement associated with the cumulative effect of HI in QSO absorption systems along the line of sight provides a distinctive feature for identifying galaxies at z$\gt$\~{}2.5. Colour criteria, which are sensitive to the presence of a Lyman continuum break superposed on an otherwise flat UV spectrum, have been shown, through Keck spectroscopy, to successfully identify a substantial population of star-forming galaxies at 3$\lt$\~{}z$\lt$\~{}3.5. Such objects have proven to be surprisingly elusive in field galaxy redshift surveys; quantification of their surface densities and morphologies is crucial for determining how and when galaxies formed. The Hubble Deep Field (HDF) observations offer the opportunity to exploit the ubiquitous effect of intergalactic absorption and obtain useful statistical constraints on the redshift distribution of galaxies to considerably fainter limits than the current spectroscopic limits. We model the HI cosmic opacity as a function of redshift, including scattering in resonant lines of the Lyman series and Lyman continuum absorption, and use stellar population synthesis models with a wide variety of ages, metallicities, dust contents and redshifts to derive colour selection criteria that provide a robust separation between high-redshift and low-redshift galaxies. From the HDF images we construct a sample of star-forming galaxies at 2$\lt$\~{}z$\lt$\~{}4.5. While none of the \~{}60 objects in the HDF having known Keck/Low-Resolution Imaging Spectrograph (LRIS) spectroscopic redshifts in the range 0$\lt$\~{}z$\lt$\~{}1.4 is found to contaminate our high-redshift sample, our colour criteria are able to efficiently select the 2.6$\lt$\~{}z$\lt$\~{}3.2 galaxies identified by Steidel et al. The ultraviolet (and blue) dropout technique opens up the possibility of investigating cosmic star and element formation in the early Universe. We set a lower limit to the ejection rate of heavy elements per unit comoving volume from Type II supernovae at $\lt$z$\gt$=2.75 of \~{}=3.6x10\^{}-4 M\_solar yr\^{}-1 Mpc\^{}-3 (for q\_0=0.5 and H\_0=50 km s\^{}-1 Mpc\^{}-1), which is 3 times higher than the local value but still 4 times lower than the rate observed at z\~{}=1. At $\lt$z$\gt$=4, our lower limit to the cosmic metal ejection rate is \~{}=3 times lower than the $\lt$z$\gt$=2.75 value. We discuss the implications of these results on models of galaxy formation, and on the chemical enrichment and ionization history of the intergalactic medium.},

  abstract = {We have detected likely z\~{}7-8 galaxies in the 144$^{''}${\times}144$^{''}$ Near-Infrared Camera and Multi-Object Spectrometer (NICMOS) observations of the Hubble Ultra Deep Field. Objects are required to be $\gt$=3 {$\sigma$} detections in both NICMOS bands, J$_{110}$ and H$_{160}$. The selection criteria for this sample are (z$_{850}$-J$_{110}$)$_{AB}$$\gt$0.8, (z$_{850}$-J$_{110}$)$_{AB}$$\gt$0.66(J$_{110}$-H$_{160}$)$_{AB}$+0.8, (J$_{110}$-H$_{160}$)$_{AB}$$\lt$1.2 and no detection at less than 8500 {\AA}. The five selected sources have total magnitudes H$_{160,AB}$\~{}27. Four of the five sources are quite blue compared to typical lower redshift dropout galaxies and are clustered within a 1 arcmin$^{2}$ region. Because all five sources are near the limit of the NICMOS data, we have carefully evaluated their reality. Each of the candidates is visible in different splits of the data and a median stack. We analyzed several noise images and estimate the number of spurious sources to be 1+/-1. A search using an independent reduction of this same data set clearly revealed three of the five candidates and weakly detected a fourth candidate, suggesting that the contamination could be higher. For comparison with predictions from lower redshift samples, we take a conservative approach and adopt four z\~{}7-8 galaxies as our sample. With the same detection criteria on simulated data sets, assuming no evolution from z\~{}3.8, we predict 10 sources at z\~{}7-8, or 14 if we use a more realistic (1+z)$^{-1}$ size scaling. We estimate that the rest-frame continuum UV (\~{}1800 {\AA}) luminosity density at z\~{}7.5 (integrated down to 0.3L$^{*}$$_{z=3}$) is just 0.20$^{+0.12}$$_{-0.08}$ times that found at z\~{}3.8 (or 0.20$^{+0.23}$$_{-0.12}$ times this quantity including cosmic variance). Effectively this sets an upper limit on the luminosity density down to 0.3L$^{*}$$_{z=3}$ and is consistent with significant evolution at the bright end of the luminosity function from z\~{}7.5 to 3.8. Even with the lower UV luminosity density at z\~{}7.5, it appears that galaxies could still play an important role in reionization at these redshifts, although definitive measurements remain to be made.

Using an i-z$\gt$1.4 cut, we find 30 i-dropouts over 21 arcmin$^{2}$ down to z$_{850,AB}$=28.1, or 1.4 i-dropouts arcmin$^{-2}$, with significant field-to-field variation (as expected from cosmic variance). This extends i-dropout searches some \~{}0.9 mag further down the luminosity function than was possible in the Great Observatories Origins Deep Survey (GOODS) fields, yielding a \~{}7 times increase in surface density. An estimate of the size evolution for UV-bright objects is obtained by comparing the composite radial flux profile of the bright i-dropouts (z$_{850,AB}$$\lt$27.2) with scaled versions of the Hubble Deep Field-North and -South U-dropouts. The best fit is found with a (1+z)$^{-1.57<SUP>+0.50}$$_{-0.53}$</SUP> scaling in size (for fixed luminosity), extending lower redshift (1$\lt$z$\lt$5) trends to z\~{}6. Adopting this scaling and the brighter i-dropouts from both GOODS fields, we make incompleteness estimates and construct a z\~{}6 luminosity function (LF) in the rest-frame continuum UV (\~{}1350 {\AA}) over a 3.5 mag baseline, finding a shape consistent with that found at lower redshift. To evaluate the evolution in the LF from z\~{}3.8, we make comparisons against different scalings of a lower redshift B-dropout sample. Although a strong degeneracy is found between luminosity and density evolution, our best-fit model scales as (1+z)$^{-2.8}$ in number and (1+z)$^{0.1}$ in luminosity, suggesting a rest-frame continuum UV luminosity density at z\~{}6 that is just 0.38$^{+0.09}$$_{-0.07}$ times that at z\~{}3.8. Our inclusion of the size evolution makes the present estimate lower than previous z\~{}6 estimates.

  abstract = {We determine the abundance of i'-band dropouts in the recently released HST/ACS Hubble Ultra-Deep Field (UDF). Because the majority of these sources are likely to be z\~{} 6 galaxies whose flux decrement between the F775W i'-band and F850LP z'-band arises from Lyman-{$\alpha$} absorption, the number of detected candidates provides a valuable upper limit to the unextincted star formation rate at this redshift. We demonstrate that the increased depth of UDF enables us to reach an 8{$\sigma$} limiting magnitude of z'$_{AB}$= 28.5 (equivalent to 1.5h$^{-2}$$_{70}$M$_{solar}$yr$^{-1}$ at z= 6.1, or 0.1L$^{*}$$_{UV}$ for the z\~{} 3U-drop population), permitting us to address earlier ambiguities arising from the unobserved form of the luminosity function. We identify 54 galaxies (and only one star) at z'$_{AB}$ $\lt$ 28.5 with (i'-z')$_{AB}$ $\gt$ 1.3 over the deepest 11-arcmin$^{2}$ portion of the UDF. The characteristic luminosity (L$^{*}$) is consistent with values observed at z\~{} 3. The faint end slope ({$\alpha$}) is less well constrained, but is consistent with only modest evolution. The main change appears to be in the number density ({$\Phi$}*). Specifically, and regardless of possible contamination from cool stars and lower-redshift sources, the UDF data support our previous result that the star formation rate at z\~{} 6 was approximately six times less than at z\~{} 3. This declining comoving star formation rate [0.005h$_{70}$M$_{solar}$yr$^{-1}$Mpc$^{-3}$ at z\~{} 6 at L$_{UV}$ $\gt$ 0.1L$^{*}$ for a Salpeter initial mass function (IMF)] poses an interesting challenge for models which suggest that L$_{UV}$ $\gt$ 0.1L$^{*}$ star-forming galaxies at z\~{}= 6 reionized the Universe. The short-fall in ionizing photons might be alleviated by galaxies fainter than our limit, or a radically different IMF. Alternatively, the bulk of reionization might have occurred at z$\gt$$\gt$ 6.},

FAST fits spectra in combination with broadband photometric data points or simultaneously fits two components, allowing for an AGN contribution in addition to the host galaxy light. Depending on the input parameters, FAST outputs the best-fit redshift, age, dust content, star formation timescale, metallicity, stellar mass, star formation rate (SFR), and their confidence intervals. Though some of FAST's functions overlap with those of HYPERZ (ascl:1108.010), it differs by fitting fluxes instead of magnitudes, allows the user to completely define the grid of input stellar population parameters and easily input photometric redshifts and their confidence intervals, and calculates calibrated confidence intervals for all parameters.

These results suggest that the rate at which star-forming galaxies are quenched increases with decreasing stellar mass, but that the bulk of the stellar mass buildup within the quiescent population occurs around \~{}10$^{10.8}$  $\{$M$\}$\_$\{$$\backslash$odot $\}$. In addition, we conclude that mergers do not appear to be a dominant channel for the stellar mass buildup of galaxies at z $\lt$ 1, even among massive (gsim 10$^{11}$  $\{$M$\}$\_$\{$$\backslash$odot $\}$) quiescent galaxies.},

  abstract      = {We estimate the galaxy stellar mass function and stellar mass density for star-forming and quiescent galaxies with 0.2 $\lt$ z $\lt$ 4. We construct a large, deep (K$_{s}$ $\lt$ 24) sample of 220 000 galaxies selected using the new UltraVISTA DR1 data release. Our analysis is based on precise 30-band photometricredshifts. By comparing these photometric redshifts with 10,800 spectroscopic redshifts from the zCOSMOS bright and faint surveys, we find a precision of {$\sigma$}$_{Δz/(1 + z)}$ = 0.008 at i$^{+}$ $\lt$ 22.5 and {$\sigma$}$_{Δz/(1 + z)}$ = 0.03 at 1.5 $\lt$ z $\lt$ 4. We derive the stellar mass function and correct for the Eddington bias. We find a mass-dependent evolution of the global and star-forming populations, with the low-mass end of the mass functions evolving more rapidly than the high-mass end. This mass-dependent evolution is a direct consequence of the star formation being ``quenched'' in galaxies more massive than {\phmmat} {\gsim} 10$^{10.7 - 10.9}${\phmmat}$_{⊙}$. For the mass function of the quiescent galaxies, we do not find any significant evolution of the high-mass end at z $\lt$ 1; however we observe a clear flattening of the faint-end slope. From z \~{} 3 to z \~{} 1, the density of quiescent galaxies increases over the entire mass range. Their comoving stellar mass density increases by 1.6 dex between z \~{} 3 and z \~{} 1 and by less than 0.2 dex at z $\lt$ 1. We infer the star formation history from the mass density evolution. This inferred star formation history is in excellent agreement with instantaneous star formation rate measurements at z $\lt$ 1.5, while we find differences of 0.2 dex at z $\gt$ 1.5 consistent with the expected uncertainties. We also develop a new method to infer the specific star formation rate from the mass function of star-forming galaxies. We find that the specific star formation rate of 10$^{10 - 10.5}${\phmmat}$_{⊙}$ galaxies increases continuously in the redshift range 1 $\lt$ z $\lt$ 4. Finally, we compare our results with a semi-analytical model and find that these models overestimate the density of low mass quiescent galaxies by an order of magnitude, while the density of low-mass star-forming galaxies is successfully reproduced.

  abstract      = {We present measurements of the stellar mass functions (SMFs) of star-forming and quiescent galaxies to z = 4 using a sample of 95,675 K$_{s}$ -selected galaxies in the COSMOS/UltraVISTA field. The SMFs of the combined population are in good agreement with previous measurements and show that the stellar mass density of the universe was only 50\%, 10\%, and 1\% of its current value at z \~{} 0.75, 2.0, and 3.5, respectively. The quiescent population drives most of the overall growth, with the stellar mass density of these galaxies increasing as {$\rho$}$_{star}$vprop(1 + z)$^{-4.7 ± 0.4}$ since z = 3.5, whereas the mass density of star-forming galaxies increases as {$\rho$}$_{star}$vprop(1 + z)$^{-2.3 ± 0.2}$. At z $\gt$ 2.5, star-forming galaxies dominate the total SMF at all stellar masses, although a non-zero population of quiescent galaxies persists to z = 4. Comparisons of the K$_{s}$ -selected star-forming galaxy SMFs with UV-selected SMFs at 2.5 $\lt$ z $\lt$ 4 show reasonable agreement and suggest that UV-selected samples are representative of the majority of the stellar mass density at z $\gt$ 3.5. We estimate the average mass growth of individual galaxies by selecting galaxies at fixed cumulative number density. The average galaxy with log(M $_{star}$/M $_{⊙}$) = 11.5 at z = 0.3 has grown in mass by only 0.2 dex (0.3 dex) since z = 2.0 (3.5), whereas those with log(M $_{star}$/M $_{⊙}$) = 10.5 have grown by $\gt$1.0 dex since z = 2. At z $\lt$ 2, the time derivatives of the mass growth are always larger for lower-mass galaxies, which demonstrates that the mass growth in galaxies since that redshift is mass-dependent and primarily bottom-up. Lastly, we examine potential sources of systematic uncertainties in the SMFs and find that those from photo-z templates, stellar population synthesis modeling, and the definition of quiescent galaxies dominate the total error budget in the SMFs.  Based on data products from observations made with ESO Telescopes at the La Silla Paranal Observatory under ESO programme ID 179.A-2005 and on data products produced by TERAPIX and the Cambridge Astronomy Survey Unit on behalf of the UltraVISTA consortium.},

  abstract      = {We present the discovery of six new quasars at z \~{} 6 selected from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) southern survey, a deep imaging survey obtained by repeatedly scanning a stripe along the celestial equator. The six quasars are about 2 mag fainter than the luminous z \~{} 6 quasars found in the SDSS main survey and 1 mag fainter than the quasars reported in Paper I. Four of them comprise a complete flux-limited sample at 21 $\lt$ z $_{AB}$ $\lt$ 21.8 over an effective area of 195 deg$^{2}$. The other two quasars are fainter than z $_{AB}$ = 22 and are not part of the complete sample. The quasar luminosity function at z \~{} 6 is well described as a single power law {$\Phi$}(L $_{1450}$) vprop L $^{β}$ $_{1450}$ over the luminosity range -28 $\lt$ M $_{1450}$ $\lt$ -25. The best-fitting slope {$\beta$} varies from -2.6 to -3.1, depending on the quasar samples used, with a statistical error of 0.3-0.4. About 40\% of the quasars discovered in the SDSS southern survey have very narrow Ly{$\alpha$} emission lines, which may indicate small black hole masses and high Eddington luminosity ratios, and therefore short black hole growth timescales for these faint quasars at early epochs.},

We demonstrate that the passage of redshifted polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) and silicate features into the mid-infrared wavelength window covered by AKARI is a valuable means to recover the redshifts of starburst galaxies. To this end, we have collected a sample of \~{}60 galaxies drawn from the Great Observatories Origins Deep Survey-North Field with spectroscopic redshift 0.5 $\lt$\~{} z$_{spec}$ $\lt$\~{} 1.5 and photometry from 3.6 to 24{$\mu$}m, provided by the Spitzer, Infrared Space Observatory and AKARI satellites. The infrared spectra are fitted using synthetic galaxy spectral energy distributions which account for starburst and active nuclei emission. For \~{}90 per cent of the sources in our sample, the redshift is recovered with an accuracy |z$_{phot}$ - z$_{spec}$|/(1 + z$_{spec}$) $\lt$\~{} 10 per cent. A similar analysis performed on a set of simulated spectra shows that the AKARI infrared data alone can provide photometric redshifts accurate to |z$_{phot}$ - z$_{spec}$|/(1 + z$_{spec}$) \~{} 10 per cent (1{$\sigma$}) at z $\lt$\~{} 2. At higher redshifts, the PAH features are shifted outside the wavelength range covered by AKARI and the photo-z estimates rely on the less prominent 1.6{$\mu$}m stellar bump; the accuracy achievable in this case on (1 + z) is \~{}10-15 per cent, provided that the active galactic nuclei contribution to the infrared emission is subdominant. Our technique is no more prone to redshift aliasing than optical-ultraviolet photo-z, and it may be possible to reduce this aliasing further with the addition of submillimetre and/or radio data.},

  abstract      = {Increasingly large samples of galaxies are now being discovered at redshifts z \~{} 5-6 and higher. Many of these objects are inferred to be young, low in mass, and relatively unreddened, but detailed analysis of their high quality spectra will not be possible until the advent of future facilities. In this paper, we shed light on the physical conditions in a plausibly similar low-mass galaxy by presenting the analysis of the rest-frame optical and UV spectra of Q2343-BX418, an L* galaxy at z = 2.3 with a very low mass-to-light ratio and unusual properties: BX418 is young ($\lt$100 Myr), low mass (M $_{sstarf}$ \~{} 10$^{9}$ M $_{sun}$), low in metallicity (Z \~{} 1/6 Z $_{sun}$), and unreddened (E(B - V) \~{}= 0.02, UV continuum slope {$\beta$} = -2.1). We infer a metallicity 12 + log(O/H) = 7.9 {\plusmn} 0.2 from the rest-frame optical emission lines. We also determine the metallicity via the direct, electron temperature method, using the ratio O III] {$\lambda$}{$\lambda$}1661, 1666/[O III] {$\lambda$}5007 to determine the electron temperature and finding 12 + log(O/H) = 7.8 {\plusmn} 0.1. These measurements place BX418 among the most metal-poor galaxies observed in emission at high redshift. The rest-frame UV spectrum, which represents \~{}12 hr of integration with the Keck telescope, contains strong emission from Ly{$\alpha$} (with rest-frame equivalent width 54 {\AA}), He II {$\lambda$}1640 (both stellar and nebular), C III] {$\lambda$}{$\lambda$}1907, 1909 and O III] {$\lambda$}{$\lambda$}1661, 1666. The C IV/C III] ratio indicates that the source of ionization is unlikely to be an active galactic nucleus. Analysis of the He II, O III], and C III] line strengths indicates a very high ionization parameter log U \~{} -1, while Ly{$\alpha$} and the interstellar absorption lines indicate that outflowing gas is highly ionized over a wide range of velocities. It remains to be determined how many of BX418's unique spectral features are due to its global properties, such as low metallicity and dust extinction, and how many are indicative of a short-lived phase in the early evolution of an otherwise normal star-forming galaxy.  Based on data obtained at the W. M. Keck Observatory, which is operated as a scientific partnership among the California Institute of Technology, the University of California, and NASA, and was made possible by the generous financial support of the W. M. Keck Foundation.},

Methods such as flux fitting, profile fitting, and PSF homogenization followed by matched-aperture photometry are all computationally expensive. We present an alternative solution called ``synthetic aperture photometry'' that exploits galaxy profile fits in one band to efficiently model the observed, point-spread-function-convolved light profile in other bands and predict the flux in arbitrarily sized apertures. Because aperture magnitudes are the most widely tabulated flux measurements in survey catalogs, producing synthetic aperture magnitudes (SYNMAGs) enables very fast matched photometry at the catalog level, without reprocessing imaging data. We make our code public and apply it to obtain matched photometry between Sloan Digital Sky Survey ugriz and UKIDSS YJHK imaging, recovering red-sequence colors and photometric redshifts with a scatter and accuracy as good as if not better than FWHM-homogenized photometry from the GAMA Survey. Finally, we list some specific measurements that upcoming surveys could make available to facilitate and ease the use of SYNMAGs.},

By combining the data from two complete sky coverage epochs in an advanced data processing system, AllWISE has generated new products that have enhanced photometric sensitivity and accuracy, and improved astrometric precision compared with the earlier WISE All-Sky Data Release.  Exploiting the 6 month baseline between the WISE sky coverage epochs enables AllWISE to measure source motions for the first time, and to compute improved flux variability statistics.  AllWISE data release products include: a Source Catalog that contains 4-band fluxes, positions, apparent motion measurements, and flux variability statistics for over 747 million objects detected at SNR$\gt$5 in the combined exposures; a Multiepoch Photometry Database containing over 42 billion time-tagged, single-exposure fluxes for each object detected on the combined exposures; and an Image Atlas of 18,240 4-band calibrated FITS images, depth-of-coverage and noise maps that cover the sky produced by coadding nearly 7.9 million single-exposure images from the cryogenic and post-cryogenic survey phases.  The Explanatory Supplement to the AllWISE Data Release Products is a general guide for users of the AllWISE data.  The Supplement contains detailed descriptions of the format and characteristics of the AllWISE data products, as well as a summary of cautionary notes that describe known limitations.  The Supplement is an on-line document that is updated frequently to provide the most current information for users of the AllWISE data products.

This implies a much larger census of luminous AGNs than found by typical wide-area surveys, attributable to the fact that mid-infrared selection identifies both unobscured (type 1) and obscured (type 2) AGNs. Optical and soft X-ray surveys alone are highly biased toward only unobscured AGNs, while this simple WISE selection likely identifies even heavily obscured, Compton-thick AGNs. Using deep, public data in the COSMOS field, we explore the properties of WISE-selected AGN candidates. At the mid-infrared depth considered, 160 {$\mu$}Jy at 4.6 {$\mu$}m, this simple criterion identifies 78\% of Spitzer mid-infrared AGN candidates according to the criteria of Stern et al. and the reliability is 95\%.

  abstract      = {The fourth generation of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS-IV) has been in operation since 2014 July. This paper describes the second data release from this phase, and the 14th from SDSS overall (making this Data Release Fourteen or DR14). This release makes the data taken by SDSS-IV in its first two years of operation (2014-2016 July) public. Like all previous SDSS releases, DR14 is cumulative, including the most recent reductions and calibrations of all data taken by SDSS since the first phase began operations in 2000. New in DR14 is the first public release of data from the extended Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey; the first data from the second phase of the Apache Point Observatory (APO) Galactic Evolution Experiment (APOGEE-2), including stellar parameter estimates from an innovative data-driven machine-learning algorithm known as {\ldquo}The Cannon{\rdquo} and almost twice as many data cubes from the Mapping Nearby Galaxies at APO (MaNGA) survey as were in the previous release (N = 2812 in total). This paper describes the location and format of the publicly available data from the SDSS-IV surveys. We provide references to the important technical papers describing how these data have been taken (both targeting and observation details) and processed for scientific use. The SDSS web site (<A href=``http://www.sdss.org''>www.sdss.org</A>) has been updated for this release and provides links to data downloads, as well as tutorials and examples of data use. SDSS-IV is planning to continue to collect astronomical data until 2020 and will be followed by SDSS-V.},

We give a review of the algorithms employed, and describe the changes to the pipeline that have been implemented for BOSS relative to previous SDSS-I/II versions, including new sets of stellar, galaxy, and quasar redshift templates. For the color-selected ``CMASS'' sample of massive galaxies at redshift 0.4 $\lt$\~{} z $\lt$\~{} 0.8 targeted by BOSS for the purposes of large-scale cosmological measurements, the pipeline achieves an automated classification success rate of 98.7\% and confirms 95.4\% of unique CMASS targets as galaxies (with the balance being mostly M stars). Based on visual inspections of a subset of BOSS galaxies, we find that approximately 0.2\% of confidently reported CMASS sample classifications and redshifts are incorrect, and about 0.4\% of all CMASS spectra are objects unclassified by the current algorithm which are potentially recoverable. The BOSS pipeline confirms that \~{}51.5\% of the quasar targets have quasar spectra, with the balance mainly consisting of stars and low signal-to-noise spectra. Statistical (as opposed to systematic) redshift errors propagated from photon noise are typically a few tens of km s$^{-1}$ for both galaxies and quasars, with a significant tail to a few hundreds of km s$^{-1}$ for quasars. We test the accuracy of these statistical redshift error estimates using repeat observations, finding them underestimated by a factor of 1.19-1.34 for galaxies and by a factor of two for quasars. We assess the impact of sky-subtraction quality, signal-to-noise ratio, and other factors on galaxy redshift success. Finally, we document known issues with the BOSS DR9 spectroscopic data set and describe directions of ongoing development.},

The four sources are not detected in the deep Hubble Space Telescope WFC3 H-band image with H $_{limit}$ = 28.3 mag. We find that only three types of SED templates can produce such a red H - [3.6] color: a very dusty SED with the Calzetti extinction of A$_{V}$ = 16 mag at z = 0.8; a very dusty SED with the SMC extinction of A$_{V}$ = 8 mag at z = 2.0- 2.2; and an 1 Gyr SSP with A$_{V}$ \~{} 0.8 at z = 5.7. We argue that these sources are unlikely dusty galaxies at z $\lt$= 2.2 based on absent strong MIPS 24 {$\mu$}m emission. The old stellar population model at z $\gt$ 4.5 remains a possible solution for the 4 sources. At z $\gt$ 4.5, these sources have stellar masses of log(M $_{*}$/M $_{⊙}$) = 10.6-11.2. One source, ERS-1, is also a type-II X-ray QSO with L $_{2 - 8 keV}$ = 1.6 {\times} 10$^{44}$ erg s$^{-1}$. One of the four sources is an X-ray QSO and another one is a HyperLIRG, suggesting a galaxy-merging scenario for the formation of these massive galaxies at high redshifts.},

The sample is complete for galaxies with stellar mass $\gt$10$^{9.5}$ M $_{⊙}$ and redshift 0.4 $\lt$ z $\lt$ 1.2. In this redshift range, the Infrared Array Camera 3.6 {$\mu$}m band measures the rest-frame near-infrared band, permitting nearly unbiased selection with respect to both quiescent and star-forming galaxies. The numerous spectroscopic redshifts available in the EGS are used to train an artificial neural network to estimate photometric redshifts. The distribution of photometric redshift errors is Gaussian with standard deviation \~{}0.025(1 + z), and the fraction of redshift failures ($\gt$3{$\sigma$} errors) is about 3.5\%. A new method of validation based on pair statistics confirms the estimate of standard deviation even for galaxies lacking spectroscopic redshifts. Basic galaxy properties measured include rest-frame U - B colors, B- and K-band absolute magnitudes, and stellar masses. We divide the sample into quiescent and star-forming galaxies according to their rest-frame U - B colors and 24-3.6 {$\mu$}m flux density ratios and derive rest K-band luminosity functions and stellar mass functions for quiescent, star-forming, and all galaxies. The results show that massive, quiescent galaxies were in place by z {\ap} 1, but lower mass galaxies generally ceased their star formation at later epochs.},

  abstract      = {We present a study of the infrared properties for a sample of seven spectroscopically confirmed submillimeter galaxies (SMGs) at z $\gt$ 4.0. By combining ground-based near-infrared, Spitzer IRAC and MIPS, Herschel SPIRE, and ground-based submillimeter/millimeter photometry, we construct their spectral energy distributions (SEDs) and a composite model to fit the SEDs. The model includes a stellar emission component at {$\lambda$}$_{rest}$ $\lt$ 3.5 {$\mu$}m, a hot dust component peaking at {$\lambda$}$_{rest}$ \~{} 5 {$\mu$}m, and cold dust component which becomes significant for {$\lambda$}$_{rest}$ $\gt$ 50 {$\mu$}m. Six objects in the sample are detected at 250 and 350 {$\mu$}m. The dust temperatures for the sources in this sample are in the range of 40-80 K, and their L $_{FIR}$ \~{} 10$^{13}$ L $_{⊙}$ qualifies them as hyper-luminous infrared galaxies. The mean FIR-radio index for this sample is around langqrang = 2.2 indicating no radio excess in their radio emission. Most sources in the sample have 24 {$\mu$}m detections corresponding to a rest-frame 4.5 {$\mu$}m luminosity of Log$_{10}$(L $_{4.5}$/L $_{⊙}$) = 11 \~{} 11.5. Their L $_{4.5}$/L $_{FIR}$ ratios are very similar to those of starburst-dominated SMGs at z \~{} 2. The L $_{CO}$ - L $_{FIR}$ relation for this sample is consistent with that determined for local ULIRGs and SMGs at z \~{} 2. We conclude that SMGs at z $\gt$ 4 are hotter and more luminous in the FIR but otherwise very similar to those at z \~{} 2. None of these sources show any sign of the strong QSO phase being triggered.

This dataset is unrivaled in cosmological imaging surveys due to its combination of area ($458$ deg$^2$ before masking), depth ($r\le25$), and wavelength coverage ($ugriZY\!J\!H\!K\_{\rm s}$). The combination of survey depth, area, and (most importantly) wavelength coverage allows significant reductions in systematic uncertainties (i.e. reductions of between 10 and 60$\backslash$\% in bias, outlier rate, and scatter) in photometric-to-spectroscopic redshift comparisons, compared to the optical-only case at photo-$z$ above $0.7$. The complementarity between our optical and NIR surveys means that over $80\\%$ of our sources, across all photo-$z$, have significant detections (i.e. not upper limits) in our $8$ reddest bands. We derive photometry, photo-$z$, and stellar masses for all sources in the survey, and verify these data products against existing spectroscopic galaxy samples. We demonstrate the fidelity of our higher-level data products by constructing the survey stellar mass functions in 8 volume-complete redshift bins. We find that these photometrically derived mass functions provide excellent agreement with previous mass evolution studies derived using spectroscopic surveys. The primary data products presented in this paper are publicly available at http://kids.strw.leidenuniv.nl/.},

  abstract      = {<BR /> Aims: To separate stars and galaxies in the far infrared AKARI all-sky survey data, we have selected a sample with the complete color information available in the low extinction regions of the sky and constructed color-color plots for these data. We looked for the method of separating stars and galaxies using the color information. <BR /> Methods: We performed an extensive search for the counterparts of these selected all-sky survey objects in the NED and SIMBAD databases. Among 5176 selected objects, we found 4272 galaxies, 382 other extragalactic objects, 349 Milky Way stars, 50 other Galactic objects, and 101 sources detected before in various wavelengths but of an unknown origin. Twenty-two sources were left unidentified. Then, we checked the colors of stars and galaxies in the far-infrared flux-color and color-color plots. <BR /> Results: In the resulting diagrams, stars form two clearly separated clouds. One of them is easily distinguished from galaxies and allows for a simple method of excluding a large part of stars using the far-infrared data. The other smaller branch, overplotting galaxies, consists of stars known to have an infrared excess, like Vega and some fainter stars discovered by IRAS or 2MASS. The color properties of these objects in any case make them very difficult to distinguish from galaxies. <BR /> Conclusions: We conclude that the FIR color-color diagrams allow for a high-quality star-galaxy separation. With the proposed simple method we can select more that 95\% of galaxies rejecting at least 80\% of stars.

  abstract = {We describe the algorithm that selects the main sample of galaxies for spectroscopy in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) from the photometric data obtained by the imaging survey. Galaxy photometric properties are measured using the Petrosian magnitude system, which measures flux in apertures determined by the shape of the surface brightness profile. The metric aperture used is essentially independent of cosmological surface brightness dimming, foreground extinction, sky brightness, and the galaxy central surface brightness. The main galaxy sample consists of galaxies with r-band Petrosian magnitudes r$\lt$=17.77 and r-band Petrosian half-light surface brightnesses {$\mu$}$_{50}$$\lt$=24.5 mag arcsec$^{-2}$. These cuts select about 90 galaxy targets per square degree, with a median redshift of 0.104. We carry out a number of tests to show that (1) our star-galaxy separation criterion is effective at eliminating nearly all stellar contamination while removing almost no genuine galaxies, (2) the fraction of galaxies eliminated by our surface brightness cut is very small (\~{}0.1\%), (3) the completeness of the sample is high, exceeding 99\%, and (4) the reproducibility of target selection based on repeated imaging scans is consistent with the expected random photometric errors. The main cause of incompleteness is blending with saturated stars, which becomes more significant for brighter, larger galaxies. The SDSS spectra are of high enough signal-to-noise ratio (S/N$\gt$4 per pixel) that essentially all targeted galaxies (99.9\%) yield a reliable redshift (i.e., with statistical error less than 30 km s$^{-1}$). About 6\% of galaxies that satisfy the selection criteria are not observed because they have a companion closer than the 55`` minimum separation of spectroscopic fibers, but these galaxies can be accounted for in statistical analyses of clustering or galaxy properties. The uniformity and completeness of the galaxy sample make it ideal for studies of large-scale structure and the characteristics of the galaxy population in the local universe.},

The targets are all galaxies brighter than K$_{tot}$= 12.75 in the 2MASS Extended Source Catalog (XSC), supplemented by 2MASS and SuperCOSMOS galaxies that complete the sample to limits of (H, J, r$_{F}$, b$_{J}$) = (13.05, 13.75, 15.6, 16.75). Central to the survey is the Six-Degree Field (6dF) multifibre spectrograph, an instrument able to record 150 simultaneous spectra over the -field of the UK Schmidt Telescope. An adaptive tiling algorithm has been employed to ensure around 95 per cent fibring completeness over the 17046 deg$^{2}$ of the southern sky with |b| $\gt$ 10{\deg}. Spectra are obtained in two observations using separate V and R gratings, that together give R\~{} 1000 over at least 4000-7500{\AA}and signal-to-noise ratio \~{}10 per pixel.

  abstract = {This paper presents the {\ldquo}First Epoch{\rdquo} sample from the VIMOS VLT Deep Survey (VVDS). The VVDS goals, observations, data reduction with the VIPGI pipeline and redshift measurement scheme with KBRED are discussed. Data have been obtained with the VIsible Multi Object Spectrograph (VIMOS) on the ESO-VLT UT3, allowing us to observe {\sime}600 slits simultaneously at a spectral resolution R{\sime}230. A total of 11 564 objects have been observed in the VVDS-02h and VVDS-CDFS {\ldquo}Deep{\rdquo} fields over a total area of 0.61 deg\^{}2, selected solely on the basis of apparent magnitude 17.5 {\le} I$_{AB}$ {\le} 24. The VVDS efficiently covers the redshift range 0 $\lt$ z {\le} 5. It is successfully going through the {\ldquo}redshift desert{\rdquo} 1.5$\lt$z$\lt$2.2, while the range 2.2 $\lt$ z $\lt$ 2.7 remains of difficult access because of the VVDS wavelength coverage. A total of 9677 galaxies have a redshift measurement, 836 objects are stars, 90 objects are AGN, and a redshift could not be measured for 961 objects. There are 1065 galaxies with a measured redshift z{\ge}1.4. When considering only the primary spectroscopic targets, the survey reaches a redshift measurement completeness of 78\% overall (93\% including less reliable flag 1 objects), with a spatial sampling of the population of galaxies of \~{}25\% and \~{}30\% in the VVDS-02h and VVDS-CDFS respectively. The redshift accuracy measured from repeated observations with VIMOS and comparison to other surveys is \~{}276 km s$^{-1}$. From this sample we are able to present for the first time the redshift distribution of a magnitude-limited spectroscopic sample down to I$_{AB}$=24. The redshift distribution N(z) has a median of z=0.62, z=0.65, z=0.70, and z=0.76, for magnitude-limited samples with I$_{AB}${\le}22.5, 23.0, 23.5 and 24.0 respectively. A high redshift tail above redshift 2 and up to redshift 5 becomes readily apparent for I$_{AB}$$\gt$23.5, probing the bright star-forming population of galaxies. This sample provides an unprecedented dataset to study galaxy evolution over \~{}90\% of the life of the universe.},

  abstract      = {We present accurate photometric redshifts (photo-z) in the 2-deg$^{2}$ COSMOS field. The redshifts are computed with 30 broad, intermediate, and narrowbands covering the UV (Galaxy Evolution Explorer), visible near-IR (NIR; Subaru, Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope (CFHT), United Kingdom Infrared Telescope, and National Optical Astronomy Observatory), and mid-IR (Spitzer/IRAC). A {$\chi$}$^{2}$ template-fitting method (Le Phare) was used and calibrated with large spectroscopic samples from the Very Large Telescope Visible Multi-Object Spectrograph and the Keck Deep Extragalactic Imaging Multi-Object Spectrograph. We develop and implement a new method which accounts for the contributions from emission lines ([O II], H{$\beta$}, H{$\alpha$}, and Ly{$\alpha$}) to the spectral energy distributions (SEDs). The treatment of emission lines improves the photo-z accuracy by a factor of 2.5. Comparison of the derived photo-z with 4148 spectroscopic redshifts (i.e., {$\Delta$}z = z $_{s}$ - z $_{p}$) indicates a dispersion of {$\sigma$}\_$\{${$\Delta$} z/(1+z\_s)$\}$=0.007 at i $^{+}$ $_{AB}$ $\lt$ 22.5, a factor of 2-6 times more accurate than earlier photo-z in the COSMOS, CFHT Legacy Survey, and the Classifying Object by Medium-Band Observations-17 survey fields. At fainter magnitudes i $^{+}$ $_{AB}$ $\lt$ 24 and z $\lt$ 1.25, the accuracy is {$\sigma$}\_$\{${$\Delta$} z/(1+z\_s)$\}$=0.012. The deep NIR and Infrared Array Camera coverage enables the photo-z to be extended to z \~{} 2, albeit with a lower accuracy ({$\sigma$}\_$\{${$\Delta$} z/(1+z\_s)$\}$=0.06 at i $^{+}$ $_{AB}$ \~{} 24). The redshift distribution of large magnitude-selected samples is derived and the median redshift is found to range from z $_{m}$ = 0.66 at 22 $\lt$ i $^{+}$ $_{AB}$ $\lt$ 22.5 to z $_{m}$ = 1.06 at 24.5 $\lt$ i $^{+}$ $_{AB}$ $\lt$ 25. At i $^{+}$ $_{AB}$ $\lt$ 26.0, the multiwavelength COSMOS catalog includes approximately 607,617 objects.

  abstract = {Photometric redshifts are quickly becoming an essential tool of observational cosmology, although their utilization is somewhat hindered by certain shortcomings of the existing methods, e.g., the unreliability of maximum-likelihood techniques or the limited application range of the ``training-set'' approach. The application of Bayesian inference to the problem of photometric redshift estimation effectively overcomes most of these problems. The use of prior probabilities and Bayesian marginalization facilitates the inclusion of relevant knowledge, such as the expected shape of the redshift distributions and the galaxy type fractions, which can be readily obtained from existing surveys but are often ignored by other methods. If this previous information is lacking or insufficient-for instance, because of the unprecedented depth of the observations-the corresponding prior distributions can be calibrated using even the data sample for which the photometric redshifts are being obtained. An important advantage of Bayesian statistics is that the accuracy of the redshift estimation can be characterized in a way that has no equivalents in other statistical approaches, enabling the selection of galaxy samples with extremely reliable photometric redshifts. In this way, it is possible to determine the properties of individual galaxies more accurately, and simultaneously estimate the statistical properties of a sample in an optimal fashion. Moreover, the Bayesian formalism described here can be easily generalized to deal with a wide range of problems that make use of photometric redshifts. There is excellent agreement between the \~{}130 Hubble Deep Field North (HDF-N) spectroscopic redshifts and the predictions of the method, with a rms error of {$\Delta$}z\~{}0.06(1+z$_{spec}$) up to z$\lt$6 and no outliers nor systematic biases. It should be remarked that since these results have not been reached following a training-set procedure, the above value of {$\Delta$}z should be a fair estimate of the expected accuracy for any similar sample. The method is further tested by estimating redshifts in the HDF-N but restricting the color information to the UBVI filters; the results are shown to be significantly more reliable than those obtained with maximum-likelihood techniques.},

We use the spatial positions and morphologies of objects in an image with higher angular resolution to construct object templates, which are then fitted to a lower resolution image, solving for the object fluxes as free parameters. Using extensive experiments on both simulated and real data, we show that this template-fitting method measures accurate object photometry to the limiting sensitivity of the image. In this limit, our method derives robust flux upper limits for objects fainter than the limiting image surface brightness. We describe the challenges encountered in applying this technique to real data, and methods to cope with some of them.},

Unlike the standard template-fitting photometric redshift technique, a large spectroscopically-identified training set is required but, where one is available, ANNs produce photometric redshift accuracies at least as good as and often better than the template-fitting method. The Bayesian priors on the underlying redshift distribution are automatically taken into account. Furthermore, inputs other than galaxy colours - such as morphology, angular size and surface brightness - may be easily incorporated, and their utility assessed.  Different ANN architectures are tested on a semi-analytic model galaxy catalogue and the results are compared with the template-fitting method. Finally, the method is tested on a sample of \~{}20000 galaxies from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. The rms redshift error in the range z$\lt$\~{} 0.35 is {$\sigma$}$_{z}$\~{} 0.021.},

  abstract      = {We describe the construction and general features of VIPERS, the VIMOS Public Extragalactic Redshift Survey. This ESO Large Programme is using the Very Large Telescope with the aim of building a spectroscopic sample of \~{} 100 000 galaxies with i$_{AB}$$\lt$ 22.5 and 0.5 $\lt$z$\lt$ 1.5. The survey covers a total area of \~{} 24 deg$^{2}$ within the CFHTLS-Wide W1 and W4 fields. VIPERS is designed to address a broad range of problems in large-scale structure and galaxy evolution, thanks to a unique combination of volume (\~{} 5 {\times} 10$^{7}$h$^{-3}$ Mpc$^{3}$) and sampling rate (\~{} 40\%), comparable to state-of-the-art surveys of the local Universe, together with extensive multi-band optical and near-infrared photometry. Here we present the survey design, the selection of the source catalogue and the development of the spectroscopic observations. We discuss in detail the overall selection function that results from the combination of the different constituents of the project. This includes the masks arising from the parent photometric sample and the spectroscopic instrumental footprint, together with the weights needed to account for the sampling and the success rates of the observations. Using the catalogue of 53 608 galaxy redshifts composing the forthcoming VIPERS Public Data Release 1 (PDR-1), we provide a first assessment of the quality of the spectroscopic data. The stellar contamination is found to be only 3.2\%, endorsing the quality of the star-galaxy separation process and fully confirming the original estimates based on the VVDS data, which also indicate a galaxy incompleteness from this process of only 1.4\%. Using a set of 1215 repeated observations, we estimate an rms redshift error {$\sigma$}$_{z}$/ (1 + z) = 4.7 {\times} 10$^{-4}$ and calibrate the internal spectral quality grading. Benefiting from the combination of size and detailed sampling of this dataset, we conclude by presenting a map showing in unprecedented detail the large-scale distribution of galaxies between 5 and 8 billion years ago.  Based on observations collected at the European Southern Observatory, Cerro Paranal, Chile, using the Very Large Telescope under programmes 182.A-0886 and partly 070.A-9007.

  abstract      = {We present the full public data release (PDR-2) of the VIMOS Public Extragalactic Redshift Survey (VIPERS), performed at the ESO VLT. We release redshifts, spectra, CFHTLS magnitudes and ancillary information (as masks and weights) for a complete sample of 86 775 galaxies (plus 4732 other objects, including stars and serendipitous galaxies); we also include their full photometrically-selected parent catalogue. The sample is magnitude limited to i$_{AB}$ {\le} 22.5, with an additional colour-colour pre-selection devised as to exclude galaxies at z $\lt$ 0.5. This practically doubles the effective sampling of the VIMOS spectrograph over the range 0.5 $\lt$ z $\lt$ 1.2 (reaching 47\% on average), yielding a final median local galaxy density close to 5 {\times} 10$^{-3}$h$^{3}$ Mpc$^{-3}$. The total area spanned by the final data set is {\sime} 23.5 deg$^{2}$, corresponding to 288 VIMOS fields with marginal overlaps, split over two regions within the CFHTLS-Wide W1 and W4 equatorial fields (at RA {\sime} 2 and {\sime} 22 h, respectively). Spectra were observed at a resolution R = 220, covering a wavelength range 5500-9500 {\AA}. Data reduction and redshift measurements were performed through a fully automated pipeline; all redshift determinations were then visually validated and assigned a quality flag. Measurements with a quality flag {\ge} 2 are shown to have a confidence level of 96\% or larger and make up 88\% of all measured galaxy redshifts (76 552 out of 86 775), constituting the VIPERS prime catalogue for statistical investigations. For this sample the rms redshift error, estimated using repeated measurements of about 3000 galaxies, is found to be {$\sigma$}$_{z}$ = 0.00054(1 + z). All data are available at $\lt$ext-link ext-link-type=``uri'' xlink:href=``http://vipers.inaf.it''$\gt$http://vipers.inaf.it$\lt$/ext-link$\gt$ and on the ESO Archive.

  abstract      = {The WiggleZ Dark Energy Survey is a survey of 240000 emission-line galaxies in the distant Universe, measured with the AAOmega spectrograph on the 3.9-m Anglo-Australian Telescope (AAT). The primary aim of the survey is to precisely measure the scale of baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) imprinted on the spatial distribution of these galaxies at look-back times of 4-8Gyr.  The target galaxies are selected using ultraviolet (UV) photometry from the Galaxy Evolution Explorer satellite, with a flux limit of NUV $\lt$ 22.8mag. We also require that the targets are detected at optical wavelengths, specifically in the range 20.0 $\lt$ r $\lt$ 22.5mag. We use the Lyman break method applied to the UV colours, with additional optical colour limits, to select high-redshift galaxies. The galaxies generally have strong emission lines, permitting reliable redshift measurements in relatively short exposure times on the AAT. The median redshift of the galaxies is z$_{med}$ = 0.6. The redshift range containing 90 per cent of the galaxies is 0.2 $\lt$ z $\lt$ 1.0.  The survey will sample a volume of \~{}1Gpc$^{3}$ over a projected area on the sky of 1000 deg$^{2}$, with an average target density of 350deg$^{-2}$. Detailed forecasts indicate that the survey will measure the BAO scale to better than 2 per cent and the tangential and radial acoustic wave scales to approximately 3 and 5 per cent, respectively. Combining the WiggleZ constraints with existing cosmic microwave background measurements and the latest supernova data, the marginalized uncertainties in the cosmological model are expected to be {$\sigma$}({$\Omega$}$_{m}$) = 0.02 and {$\sigma$}(w) = 0.07 (for a constant w model). The WiggleZ measurement of w will constitute a robust, precise and independent test of dark energy models.  This paper provides a detailed description of the survey and its design, as well as the spectroscopic observations, data reduction and redshift measurement techniques employed. It also presents an analysis of the properties of the target galaxies, including emission-line diagnostics which show that they are mostly extreme starburst galaxies, and Hubble Space Telescope images, which show that they contain a high fraction of interacting or distorted systems. In conjunction with this paper, we make a public data release of data for the first 100000 galaxies measured for the project.},

  abstract      = {This paper presents cosmological results from the final data release of the WiggleZ Dark Energy Survey. We perform full analyses of different cosmological models using the WiggleZ power spectra measured at z=0.22, 0.41, 0.60, and 0.78, combined with other cosmological data sets. The limiting factor in this analysis is the theoretical modeling of the galaxy power spectrum, including nonlinearities, galaxy bias, and redshift-space distortions. In this paper we assess several different methods for modeling the theoretical power spectrum, testing them against the Gigaparsec WiggleZ simulations (GiggleZ). We fit for a base set of six cosmological parameters, $\{${$\Omega$}$_{b}$h$^{2}$,{$\Omega$}$_{CDM}$h$^{2}$,H$_{0}$,{$\tau$},A$_{s}$,n$_{s}$$\}$, and five supplementary parameters $\{$n$_{run}$,r,w,{$\Omega$}$_{k}$,{\sum}m$_{ν}$$\}$. In combination with the cosmic microwave background, our results are consistent with the {$\Lambda$}CDM concordance cosmology, with a measurement of the matter density of {$\Omega$}$_{m}$=0.29{\plusmn}0.016 and amplitude of fluctuations {$\sigma$}$_{8}$=0.825{\plusmn}0.017. Using WiggleZ data with cosmic microwave background and other distance and matter power spectra data, we find no evidence for any of the extension parameters being inconsistent with their {$\Lambda$}CDM model values. The power spectra data and theoretical modeling tools are available for use as a module for CosmoMC, which we here make publicly available at http://smp.uq.edu.au/wigglez-data. We also release the data and random catalogs used to construct the baryon acoustic oscillation correlation function.},

  abstract  = {The DEIMOS spectrograph has now been installed on the Keck-II telescope and commissioning is nearly complete. The DEEP2 Redshift Survey, which will take approximately 120 nights at the Keck Observatory over a three year period and has been designed to utilize the power of DEIMOS, began in the summer of 2002. The multiplexing power and high efficiency of DEIMOS enables us to target 1000 faint galaxies per clear night. Our goal is to gather high-quality spectra of {\asymp} 60,000 galaxies with z$\gt$0.75 in order to study the properties and large scale clustering of galaxies at z {\asymp} 1. The survey will be executed at high spectral resolution, R={$\lambda$}/{$\Delta$}{$\lambda$} {\asymp} 5000, allowing us to work between the bright OH sky emission lines and to infer linewidths for many of the target galaxies (for several thousand objects, we will obtain rotation curves as well). The linewidth data will facilitate the execution of the classical redshift-volume cosmological test, which can provide a precision measurement of the equation of state of the Universe. This talk reviews the project, summarizes our science goals and presents some early DEIMOS data.},

  abstract      = {We describe the design and data analysis of the DEEP2 Galaxy Redshift Survey, the densest and largest high-precision redshift survey of galaxies at z \~{} 1 completed to date. The survey was designed to conduct a comprehensive census of massive galaxies, their properties, environments, and large-scale structure down to absolute magnitude M$_{B}$ = -20 at z \~{} 1 via \~{}90 nights of observation on the Keck telescope. The survey covers an area of 2.8 deg$^{2}$ divided into four separate fields observed to a limiting apparent magnitude of R $_{AB}$ = 24.1. Objects with z $\lt$\~{} 0.7 are readily identifiable using BRI photometry and rejected in three of the four DEEP2 fields, allowing galaxies with z $\gt$ 0.7 to be targeted \~{}2.5 times more efficiently than in a purely magnitude-limited sample. Approximately 60\% of eligible targets are chosen for spectroscopy, yielding nearly 53,000 spectra and more than 38,000 reliable redshift measurements. Most of the targets that fail to yield secure redshifts are blue objects that lie beyond z \~{} 1.45, where the [O II] 3727 {\AA} doublet lies in the infrared. The DEIMOS 1200 line mm$^{-1}$ grating used for the survey delivers high spectral resolution (R \~{} 6000), accurate and secure redshifts, and unique internal kinematic information. Extensive ancillary data are available in the DEEP2 fields, particularly in the Extended Groth Strip, which has evolved into one of the richest multiwavelength regions on the sky. This paper is intended as a handbook for users of the DEEP2 Data Release 4, which includes all DEEP2 spectra and redshifts, as well as for the DEEP2 DEIMOS data reduction pipelines. Extensive details are provided on object selection, mask design, biases in target selection and redshift measurements, the spec2d two-dimensional data-reduction pipeline, the spec1d automated redshift pipeline, and the zspec visual redshift verification process, along with examples of instrumental signatures or other artifacts that in some cases remain after data reduction. Redshift errors and catastrophic failure rates are assessed through more than 2000 objects with duplicate observations. Sky subtraction is essentially photon-limited even under bright OH sky lines; we describe the strategies that permitted this, based on high image stability, accurate wavelength solutions, and powerful B-spline modeling methods. We also investigate the impact of targets that appear to be single objects in ground-based targeting imaging but prove to be composite in Hubble Space Telescope data; they constitute several percent of targets at z \~{} 1, approaching \~{}5\%-10\% at z $\gt$ 1.5. Summary data are given that demonstrate the superiority of DEEP2 over other deep high-precision redshift surveys at z \~{} 1 in terms of redshift accuracy, sample number density, and amount of spectral information. We also provide an overview of the scientific highlights of the DEEP2 survey thus far.  Based on observations taken at the W. M. Keck Observatory, which is operated jointly by the University of California and the California Institute of Technology, and on observations made with the NASA/ESO Hubble Space Telescope, obtained from the data archives at the Space Telescope Science Institute, which is operated by the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy, Inc., under NASA contract NAS5-26555, and from the Canadian Astronomy Data Centre.},

  abstract      = {Context. Deep representative surveys of galaxies at different epochs are needed to make progress in understanding galaxy evolution. <BR /> Aims: We describe the completed VIMOS VLT Deep Survey and the final data release of 35 016 galaxies and type-I AGN with measured spectroscopic redshifts covering all epochs up to redshift z \~{} 6.7, in areas from 0.142 to 8.7 square degrees, and volumes from 0.5 {\times} 10$^{6}$ to 2 {\times} 10$^{7}$ h$^{-3}$ Mpc$^{3}$. <BR /> Methods: We selected samples of galaxies based solely on their i-band magnitude reaching i$_{AB}$ = 24.75. Spectra were obtained with VIMOS on the ESO-VLT integrating 0.75 h, 4.5 h, and 18 h for the Wide, Deep, and Ultra-Deep nested surveys, respectively. We demonstrate that any ``redshift desert'' can be crossed successfully using spectra covering 3650 {\le} {$\lambda$} {\le} 9350 {\AA}. A total of 1263 galaxies were again observed independently within the VVDS and from the VIPERS and MASSIV surveys. They were used to establish the redshift measurements reliability, to assess completeness in the VVDS sample, and to provide a weighting scheme taking the survey selection function into account. We describe the main properties of the VVDS samples, and the VVDS is compared to other spectroscopic surveys in the literature. <BR /> Results: In total we have obtained spectroscopic redshifts for 34 594 galaxies, 422 type-I AGN, and 12 430 Galactic stars. The survey enabled identifying galaxies up to very high redshifts with 4669 redshifts in 1 {\le} z$_{spec}$ {\le} 2, 561 in 2 {\le} z$_{spec}$ {\le} 3, and 468 with z$_{spec}$ $\gt$ 3, and specific populations like Lyman-{$\alpha$} emitters were identified out to z = 6.62. We show that the VVDS occupies a unique place in the parameter space defined by area, depth, redshift coverage, and number of spectra. <BR /> Conclusions: The VIMOS VLT Deep Survey provides a comprehensive survey of the distant universe, covering all epochs since z \~{} 6, or more than 12 Gyr of cosmic time, with a uniform selection, which is the largest such sample to date. A wealth of science results derived from the VVDS have shed new light on the evolution of galaxies and AGN and on their distribution in space over this large cosmic time. The VVDS further demonstrates that large deep spectroscopic redshift surveys over all these epochs in the distant Universe are a key tool to observational cosmology. To enhance the legacy value of the survey, a final public release of the complete VVDS spectroscopic redshift sample is available at $\lt$ext-link ext-link-type=``uri'' xlink:href=``http://cesam.lam.fr/vvds''$\gt$http://cesam.lam.fr/vvds$\lt$/ext-link$\gt$.},

We compute the N(z) and provide reference parametric fits for i band, J, H and Ks band magnitud limited samples. The N(z) of a sample with iAB$\lt$24 has a mean redshift z=0.92, with 8.2\% of the galaxies with z$\gt$2. Down to iAB$\lt$24.75 the sample has a mean redshift z=1.15 and 17.1\% of the galaxies are beyond z=2. The projected sky density is 2.07+/-0.12 gal/arcmin2 at 1.4$\lt$z$\lt$2.5 and KsAB$\lt$22.5, 1.72+/-0.15 gal/arcmin2 at 2.7$\lt$z$\lt$3.4 and 0.59+/-0.09 gal/arcmin2 at 3.4$\lt$z$\lt$4.5 brighter than iAB=24.75. Galaxies at z\~{}3 identified from magnitude-selected samples are 1.5 to 3 times more numerous than when they are colour-colour selected. We demonstrate that colour-colour selected samples over 1.4$\lt$z$\lt$4.5 are strongly contaminated by galaxies at other redshifts. Semi-analytic models on the Millennium simulations under-predict the number of luminous star-forming galaxies at z$\backslash$sim1.8-2, as well as over-predict the number of low-luminosity galaxies at z$\lt$0.8. Our study provides comprehensive galaxy number counts N(z) from galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts over a large redshift domain 0$\lt$z$\lt$5, a solid basis for the measurement of volume-complete quantities. Magnitude-selected surveys identify a higher number of galaxies at z$\gt$2 than in colour-colour selected samples, and we use the magnitude-selected VVDS to emphasize the large uncertainties associated to other surveys using colour or colour-colour selected samples. Our results further demonstrate that semi-analytical models on dark matter simulations have yet to find the right balance of physical processes and time-scales to properly reproduce a fundamental galaxy population property like the observed N(z).},

  abstract      = {The VVDS-Wide survey has been designed to trace the large-scale distribution of galaxies at z \~{} 1 on comoving scales reaching \~{}100\~{}h$^{-1}$ Mpc, while providing a good control of cosmic variance over areas as large as a few square degrees. This is achieved by measuring redshifts with VIMOS at the ESO VLT to a limiting magnitude I$_{AB}$ = 22.5, targeting four independent fields with sizes of up to 4 deg$^{2}$ each.  We discuss the survey strategy which covers 8.6 deg$^{2}$ and present the general properties of the current redshift sample. This includes 32 734 spectra in the four regions, covering a total area of 6.1 deg$^{2}$ with a sampling rate of 22 to 24\%. This paper accompanies the public release of the first 18 143 redshifts of the VVDS-Wide survey from the 4 deg$^{2}$ contiguous area of the F22 field at RA = 22\^{}h. We have devised and tested an objective method to assess the quality of each spectrum, providing a compact figure-of-merit. This is particularly effective in the case of long-lasting spectroscopic surveys with varying observing conditions. Our figure of merit is a measure of the robustness of the redshift measurement and, most importantly, can be used to select galaxies with uniform high-quality spectra to carry out reliable measurements of spectral features. We also use the data available over the four independent regions to directly measure the variance in galaxy counts. We compare it with general predictions from the observed galaxy two-point correlation function at different redshifts and with that measured in mock galaxy surveys built from the Millennium simulation. The purely magnitude-limited VVDS Wide sample includes 19 977 galaxies, 304 type I AGNs, and 9913 stars. The redshift success rate is above 90\% independent of magnitude. A cone diagram of the galaxy spatial distribution provides us with the current largest overview of large-scale structure up to z \~{} 1, showing a rich texture of over- and under-dense regions. We give the mean N(z) distribution averaged over 6.1 deg$^{2}$ for a sample limited in magnitude to I$_{AB}$ = 22.5. Comparing galaxy densities from the four fields shows that in a redshift bin {$\Delta$}z = 0.1 at z \~{} 1 one still has factor-of-two variations over areas as large as \~{} 0.25 deg$^{2}$. This level of cosmic variance agrees with that obtained by integrating the galaxy two-point correlation function estimated from the F22 field alone. It is also in fairly good statistical agreement with that predicted by the Millennium simulations.  The VVDS WIDE survey currently provides the largest area coverage among redshift surveys reaching z \~{} 1. The variance estimated over the survey fields shows explicitly how clustering results from deep surveys of even 1 deg$^{2}$ size should be interpreted with caution. The survey data represent a rich data base to select complete sub-samples of high-quality spectra and to study galaxy ensemble properties and galaxy clustering over unprecedented scales at these redshifts. The redshift catalog of the 4 deg$^{2}$ F22 field is publicly available at http://cencosw.oamp.fr.},
